<h2 class="chapter">14 Support Libraries</h2>

<h3 class="section">14.1 BFD</h3>

<p><a name="index-BFD-library-381"></a>
BFD provides support for <span class="sc">gdb</span> in several ways:

     <dl>
<dt><em>identifying executable and core files</em><dd>BFD will identify a variety of file types, including a.out, coff, and
several variants thereof, as well as several kinds of core files.

     <br><dt><em>access to sections of files</em><dd>BFD parses the file headers to determine the names, virtual addresses,
sizes, and file locations of all the various named sections in files
(such as the text section or the data section).  <span class="sc">gdb</span> simply
calls BFD to read or write section <var>x</var> at byte offset <var>y</var> for
length <var>z</var>.

     <br><dt><em>specialized core file support</em><dd>BFD provides routines to determine the failing command name stored in a
core file, the signal with which the program failed, and whether a core
file matches (i.e. could be a core dump of) a particular executable
file.

     <br><dt><em>locating the symbol information</em><dd><span class="sc">gdb</span> uses an internal interface of BFD to determine where to find the
symbol information in an executable file or symbol-file.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> itself
handles the reading of symbols, since BFD does not &ldquo;understand&rdquo; debug
symbols, but <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses BFD's cached information to find the symbols,
string table, etc. 
</dl>

<h3 class="section">14.2 opcodes</h3>

<p><a name="index-opcodes-library-382"></a>
The opcodes library provides <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s disassembler.  (It's a separate
library because it's also used in binutils, for <samp><span class="file">objdump</span></samp>).

<h3 class="section">14.3 readline</h3>

<p><a name="index-readline-library-383"></a>The <code>readline</code> library provides a set of functions for use by applications
that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in.

<h3 class="section">14.4 libiberty</h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007blibiberty_007d-library-384"></a>
The <code>libiberty</code> library provides a set of functions and features
that integrate and improve on functionality found in modern operating
systems.  Broadly speaking, such features can be divided into three
groups: supplemental functions (functions that may be missing in some
environments and operating systems), replacement functions (providing
a uniform and easier to use interface for commonly used standard
functions), and extensions (which provide additional functionality
beyond standard functions).

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> uses various features provided by the <code>libiberty</code>
library, for instance the C<tt>++</tt> demangler, the <acronym>IEEE</acronym>
floating format support functions, the input options parser
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">getopt</span></samp>&rsquo;, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">obstack</span></samp>&rsquo; extension, and other functions.

<h4 class="subsection">14.4.1 <code>obstacks</code> in <span class="sc">gdb</span></h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bobstacks_007d-385"></a>
The obstack mechanism provides a convenient way to allocate and free
chunks of memory.  Each obstack is a pool of memory that is managed
like a stack.  Objects (of any nature, size and alignment) are
allocated and freed in a <acronym>LIFO</acronym> fashion on an obstack (see
<code>libiberty</code>'s documentation for a more detailed explanation of
<code>obstacks</code>).

   <p>The most noticeable use of the <code>obstacks</code> in <span class="sc">gdb</span> is in
object files.  There is an obstack associated with each internal
representation of an object file.  Lots of things get allocated on
these <code>obstacks</code>: dictionary entries, blocks, blockvectors,
symbols, minimal symbols, types, vectors of fundamental types, class
fields of types, object files section lists, object files section
offset lists, line tables, symbol tables, partial symbol tables,
string tables, symbol table private data, macros tables, debug
information sections and entries, import and export lists (som),
unwind information (hppa), dwarf2 location expressions data.  Plus
various strings such as directory names strings, debug format strings,
names of types.

   <p>An essential and convenient property of all data on <code>obstacks</code> is
that memory for it gets allocated (with <code>obstack_alloc</code>) at
various times during a debugging session, but it is released all at
once using the <code>obstack_free</code> function.  The <code>obstack_free</code>
function takes a pointer to where in the stack it must start the
deletion from (much like the cleanup chains have a pointer to where to
start the cleanups).  Because of the stack like structure of the
<code>obstacks</code>, this allows to free only a top portion of the
obstack.  There are a few instances in <span class="sc">gdb</span> where such thing
happens.  Calls to <code>obstack_free</code> are done after some local data
is allocated to the obstack.  Only the local data is deleted from the
obstack.  Of course this assumes that nothing between the
<code>obstack_alloc</code> and the <code>obstack_free</code> allocates anything
else on the same obstack.  For this reason it is best and safest to
use temporary <code>obstacks</code>.

   <p>Releasing the whole obstack is also not safe per se.  It is safe only
under the condition that we know the <code>obstacks</code> memory is no
longer needed.  In <span class="sc">gdb</span> we get rid of the <code>obstacks</code> only
when we get rid of the whole objfile(s), for instance upon reading a
new symbol file.

<h3 class="section">14.6 Array Containers</h3>

<p><a name="index-Array-Containers-387"></a><a name="index-VEC-388"></a>
Often it is necessary to manipulate a dynamic array of a set of
objects.  C forces some bookkeeping on this, which can get cumbersome
and repetitive.  The <samp><span class="file">vec.h</span></samp> file contains macros for defining
and using a typesafe vector type.  The functions defined will be
inlined when compiling, and so the abstraction cost should be zero. 
Domain checks are added to detect programming errors.

   <p>An example use would be an array of symbols or section information. 
The array can be grown as symbols are read in (or preallocated), and
the accessor macros provided keep care of all the necessary
bookkeeping.  Because the arrays are type safe, there is no danger of
accidentally mixing up the contents.  Think of these as C++ templates,
but implemented in C.

   <p>Because of the different behavior of structure objects, scalar objects
and of pointers, there are three flavors of vector, one for each of
these variants.  Both the structure object and pointer variants pass
pointers to objects around &mdash; in the former case the pointers are
stored into the vector and in the latter case the pointers are
dereferenced and the objects copied into the vector.  The scalar
object variant is suitable for <code>int</code>-like objects, and the vector
elements are returned by value.

   <p>There are both <code>index</code> and <code>iterate</code> accessors.  The iterator
returns a boolean iteration condition and updates the iteration
variable passed by reference.  Because the iterator will be inlined,
the address-of can be optimized away.

   <p>The vectors are implemented using the trailing array idiom, thus they
are not resizeable without changing the address of the vector object
itself.  This means you cannot have variables or fields of vector type
&mdash; always use a pointer to a vector.  The one exception is the final
field of a structure, which could be a vector type.  You will have to
use the <code>embedded_size</code> &amp; <code>embedded_init</code> calls to create
such objects, and they will probably not be resizeable (so don't use
the <dfn>safe</dfn> allocation variants).  The trailing array idiom is used
(rather than a pointer to an array of data), because, if we allow
<code>NULL</code> to also represent an empty vector, empty vectors occupy
minimal space in the structure containing them.

   <p>Each operation that increases the number of active elements is
available in <dfn>quick</dfn> and <dfn>safe</dfn> variants.  The former presumes
that there is sufficient allocated space for the operation to succeed
(it dies if there is not).  The latter will reallocate the vector, if
needed.  Reallocation causes an exponential increase in vector size. 
If you know you will be adding N elements, it would be more efficient
to use the reserve operation before adding the elements with the
<dfn>quick</dfn> operation.  This will ensure there are at least as many
elements as you ask for, it will exponentially increase if there are
too few spare slots.  If you want reserve a specific number of slots,
but do not want the exponential increase (for instance, you know this
is the last allocation), use a negative number for reservation.  You
can also create a vector of a specific size from the get go.

   <p>You should prefer the push and pop operations, as they append and
remove from the end of the vector. If you need to remove several items
in one go, use the truncate operation.  The insert and remove
operations allow you to change elements in the middle of the vector. 
There are two remove operations, one which preserves the element
ordering <code>ordered_remove</code>, and one which does not
<code>unordered_remove</code>.  The latter function copies the end element
into the removed slot, rather than invoke a memmove operation.  The
<code>lower_bound</code> function will determine where to place an item in
the array using insert that will maintain sorted order.

   <p>If you need to directly manipulate a vector, then the <code>address</code>
accessor will return the address of the start of the vector.  Also the
<code>space</code> predicate will tell you whether there is spare capacity in the
vector.  You will not normally need to use these two functions.

   <p>Vector types are defined using a
<code>DEF_VEC_{O,P,I}(</code><var>typename</var><code>)</code> macro.  Variables of vector
type are declared using a <code>VEC(</code><var>typename</var><code>)</code> macro.  The
characters <code>O</code>, <code>P</code> and <code>I</code> indicate whether
<var>typename</var> is an object (<code>O</code>), pointer (<code>P</code>) or integral
(<code>I</code>) type.  Be careful to pick the correct one, as you'll get an
awkward and inefficient API if you use the wrong one.  There is a
check, which results in a compile-time warning, for the <code>P</code> and
<code>I</code> versions, but there is no check for the <code>O</code> versions, as
that is not possible in plain C.

   <p>An example of their use would be,

<pre class="smallexample">     DEF_VEC_P(tree);   // non-managed tree vector.
     
     struct my_struct {
       VEC(tree) *v;      // A (pointer to) a vector of tree pointers.
     };
     
     struct my_struct *s;
     
     if (VEC_length(tree, s-&gt;v)) { we have some contents }
     VEC_safe_push(tree, s-&gt;v, decl); // append some decl onto the end
     for (ix = 0; VEC_iterate(tree, s-&gt;v, ix, elt); ix++)
       { do something with elt }
     
</pre>
   <p>The <samp><span class="file">vec.h</span></samp> file provides details on how to invoke the various
accessors provided.  They are enumerated here:
