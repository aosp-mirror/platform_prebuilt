<h2 class="chapter">19 Releasing <span class="sc">gdb</span></h2>

<p><a name="index-making-a-new-release-of-gdb-426"></a>

<h3 class="section">19.1 Branch Commit Policy</h3>

<p>The branch commit policy is pretty slack.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> releases 5.0,
5.1 and 5.2 all used the below:

     <ul>
<li>The <samp><span class="file">gdb/MAINTAINERS</span></samp> file still holds. 
<li>Don't fix something on the branch unless/until it is also fixed in the
trunk.  If this isn't possible, mentioning it in the <samp><span class="file">gdb/PROBLEMS</span></samp>
file is better than committing a hack. 
<li>When considering a patch for the branch, suggested criteria include:
Does it fix a build?  Does it fix the sequence <kbd>break main; run</kbd>
when debugging a static binary? 
<li>The further a change is from the core of <span class="sc">gdb</span>, the less likely
the change will worry anyone (e.g., target specific code). 
<li>Only post a proposal to change the core of <span class="sc">gdb</span> after you've
sent individual bribes to all the people listed in the
<samp><span class="file">MAINTAINERS</span></samp> file <tt>;-)</tt>
</ul>

   <p><em>Pragmatics: Provided updates are restricted to non-core
functionality there is little chance that a broken change will be fatal. 
This means that changes such as adding a new architectures or (within
reason) support for a new host are considered acceptable.</em>

<h3 class="section">19.2 Obsoleting code</h3>

<p>Before anything else, poke the other developers (and around the source
code) to see if there is anything that can be removed from <span class="sc">gdb</span>
(an old target, an unused file).

   <p>Obsolete code is identified by adding an <code>OBSOLETE</code> prefix to every
line.  Doing this means that it is easy to identify something that has
been obsoleted when greping through the sources.

   <p>The process is done in stages &mdash; this is mainly to ensure that the
wider <span class="sc">gdb</span> community has a reasonable opportunity to respond. 
Remember, everything on the Internet takes a week.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Post the proposal on <a href="mailto:gdb@sources.redhat.com">the GDB mailing list</a> Creating a bug report to track the task's state, is also highly
recommended. 
<li>Wait a week or so. 
<li>Post the proposal on <a href="mailto:gdb-announce@sources.redhat.com">the GDB Announcement mailing list</a>. 
<li>Wait a week or so. 
<li>Go through and edit all relevant files and lines so that they are
prefixed with the word <code>OBSOLETE</code>. 
<li>Wait until the next GDB version, containing this obsolete code, has been
released. 
<li>Remove the obsolete code.
        </ol>

<p class="noindent"><em>Maintainer note: While removing old code is regrettable it is
hopefully better for </em><span class="sc">gdb</span><em>'s long term development.  Firstly it
helps the developers by removing code that is either no longer relevant
or simply wrong.  Secondly since it removes any history associated with
the file (effectively clearing the slate) the developer has a much freer
hand when it comes to fixing broken files.</em>

<h3 class="section">19.3 Before the Branch</h3>

<p>The most important objective at this stage is to find and fix simple
changes that become a pain to track once the branch is created.  For
instance, configuration problems that stop <span class="sc">gdb</span> from even
building.  If you can't get the problem fixed, document it in the
<samp><span class="file">gdb/PROBLEMS</span></samp> file.

<h4 class="subheading">Prompt for <samp><span class="file">gdb/NEWS</span></samp></h4>

<p>People always forget.  Send a post reminding them but also if you know
something interesting happened add it yourself.  The <code>schedule</code>
script will mention this in its e-mail.

<h4 class="subheading">Review <samp><span class="file">gdb/README</span></samp></h4>

<p>Grab one of the nightly snapshots and then walk through the
<samp><span class="file">gdb/README</span></samp> looking for anything that can be improved.  The
<code>schedule</code> script will mention this in its e-mail.

<h4 class="subheading">Refresh any imported files.</h4>

<p>A number of files are taken from external repositories.  They include:

     <ul>
<li><samp><span class="file">texinfo/texinfo.tex</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="file">config.guess</span></samp> et. al. (see the top-level <samp><span class="file">MAINTAINERS</span></samp>
file)
<li><samp><span class="file">etc/standards.texi</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">etc/make-stds.texi</span></samp>
</ul>

<h4 class="subheading">Check the ARI</h4>

<p><a href="http://sources.redhat.com/gdb/ari">A.R.I.</a> is an <code>awk</code> script
(Awk Regression Index ;-) that checks for a number of errors and coding
conventions.  The checks include things like using <code>malloc</code> instead
of <code>xmalloc</code> and file naming problems.  There shouldn't be any
regressions.

<h4 class="subsection">19.3.1 Review the bug data base</h4>

<p>Close anything obviously fixed.

<h4 class="subsection">19.3.2 Check all cross targets build</h4>

<p>The targets are listed in <samp><span class="file">gdb/MAINTAINERS</span></samp>.

<h3 class="section">19.4 Cut the Branch</h3>

<h4 class="subheading">Create the branch</h4>

     $  ^echo ^^
     ...
     $
</pre>
     <ul>
<li>By using <kbd>-D YYYY-MM-DD-gmt</kbd>, the branch is forced to an exact
date/time. 
<li>The trunk is first tagged so that the branch point can easily be found. 
<li>Insight, which includes <span class="sc">gdb</span>, is tagged at the same time. 
<li><samp><span class="file">version.in</span></samp> gets bumped to avoid version number conflicts. 
<li>The reading of <samp><span class="file">.cvsrc</span></samp> is disabled using <samp><span class="file">-f</span></samp>. 
</ul>

<h4 class="subheading">Update <samp><span class="file">version.in</span></samp></h4>

<pre class="smallexample">     $  u=5.1
     $  v=5.2
     $  V=`echo $v | sed 's/\./_/g'`
     $  echo $u $v$V

     $  cat version.in
     5.1.90-0000-00-00-cvs
     $  cvs -f commit version.in
</pre>
     <ul>
<li><samp><span class="file">0000-00-00</span></samp> is used as a date to pump prime the version.in update
mechanism. 
<li><samp><span class="file">.90</span></samp> and the previous branch version are used as fairly arbitrary
initial branch version number. 
</ul>

<h4 class="subheading">Update the web and news pages</h4>

<p>Something?

<h4 class="subheading">Tweak cron to track the new branch</h4>

<p>The file <samp><span class="file">gdbadmin/cron/crontab</span></samp> contains gdbadmin's cron table. 
This file needs to be updated so that:

     <ul>
<li>A daily timestamp is added to the file <samp><span class="file">version.in</span></samp>. 
<li>The new branch is included in the snapshot process. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">See the file <samp><span class="file">gdbadmin/cron/README</span></samp> for how to install the updated
cron table.

   <p>The file <samp><span class="file">gdbadmin/ss/README</span></samp> should also be reviewed to reflect
any changes.  That file is copied to both the branch/ and current/
snapshot directories.

<h4 class="subheading">Update the NEWS and README files</h4>

<p>The <samp><span class="file">NEWS</span></samp> file needs to be updated so that on the branch it refers
to <em>changes in the current release</em> while on the trunk it also
refers to <em>changes since the current release</em>.

   <p>The <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp> file needs to be updated so that it refers to the
current release.

<h4 class="subheading">Post the branch info</h4>

<p>Send an announcement to the mailing lists:

     <ul>
<li><a href="mailto:gdb-announce@sources.redhat.com">GDB Announcement mailing list</a>
<li><a href="mailto:gdb@sources.redhat.com">GDB Discussion mailing list</a> and
<a href="mailto:gdb-testers@sources.redhat.com">GDB Testers mailing list</a>
</ul>

   <p><em>Pragmatics: The branch creation is sent to the announce list to
ensure that people people not subscribed to the higher volume discussion
list are alerted.</em>

   <p>The announcement should include:

     <ul>
<li>The branch tag. 
<li>How to check out the branch using CVS. 
<li>The date/number of weeks until the release. 
<li>The branch commit policy still holds. 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">19.5 Stabilize the branch</h3>

<p>Something goes here.

<h3 class="section">19.6 Create a Release</h3>

<p>The process of creating and then making available a release is broken
down into a number of stages.  The first part addresses the technical
process of creating a releasable tar ball.  The later stages address the
process of releasing that tar ball.

   <p>When making a release candidate just the first section is needed.

<h4 class="subsection">19.6.1 Create a release candidate</h4>

<p>The objective at this stage is to create a set of tar balls that can be
made available as a formal release (or as a less formal release
candidate).

<h5 class="subsubheading">Freeze the branch</h5>

<p>Send out an e-mail notifying everyone that the branch is frozen to
<a href="mailto:gdb-patches@sources.redhat.com">gdb-patches@sources.redhat.com</a>.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Establish a few defaults.</h5>

<pre class="smallexample">     $  b=gdb_5_2-branch

     /home/gdbadmin/bin/autoconf
     $
</pre>
<p class="noindent">Notes:

     <ul>
<li>Check the <code>autoconf</code> version carefully.  You want to be using the
version taken from the <samp><span class="file">binutils</span></samp> snapshot directory, which can be
found at <a href="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/binutils/">ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/binutils/</a>. It is very
unlikely that a system installed version of <code>autoconf</code> (e.g.,
<samp><span class="file">/usr/bin/autoconf</span></samp>) is correct. 
</ul>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Check out the relevant modules:</h5>

<pre class="smallexample">     $  for m in gdb insight

</pre>
<p class="noindent">Note:

     <ul>
<li>The reading of <samp><span class="file">.cvsrc</span></samp> is disabled (<samp><span class="file">-f</span></samp>) so that there isn't
any confusion between what is written here and what your local
<code>cvs</code> really does. 
</ul>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Update relevant files.</h5>

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="file">gdb/NEWS</span></samp><dd>
Major releases get their comments added as part of the mainline.  Minor
releases should probably mention any significant bugs that were fixed.

     <p>Don't forget to include the <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> entry.

     <pre class="smallexample">          $  emacs gdb/src/gdb/NEWS

<h5 class="subsubheading">Do the dirty work</h5>

<p>This is identical to the process used to create the daily snapshot.

   <p>If the top level source directory does not have <samp><span class="file">src-release</span></samp>
(<span class="sc">gdb</span> version 5.3.1 or earlier), try these commands instead:

<pre class="smallexample">     $  for m in gdb insight
     do
     ( cd $m/src &amp;&amp; gmake -f Makefile.in $m.tar )
     done
</pre>
   <h5 class="subsubheading">Check the source files</h5>

<p>You're looking for files that have mysteriously disappeared. 
<kbd>distclean</kbd> has the habit of deleting files it shouldn't.  Watch out
for the <samp><span class="file">version.in</span></samp> update <kbd>cronjob</kbd>.

<pre class="smallexample">     $  ( cd gdb/src &amp;&amp; cvs -f -q -n update )

<h5 class="subsubheading">Create compressed versions of the release</h5>

<pre class="smallexample">     $  cp */src/*.tar .

</pre>
<p class="noindent">Note:

     <ul>
<li>A pipe such as <kbd>bunzip2 &lt; xxx.bz2 | gzip -9 &gt; xxx.gz</kbd> is not since,
in that mode, <code>gzip</code> does not know the name of the file and, hence,
can not include it in the compressed file.  This is also why the release
process runs <code>tar</code> and <code>bzip2</code> as separate passes. 
</ul>

<h4 class="subsection">19.6.2 Sanity check the tar ball</h4>

<p>Pick a popular machine (Solaris/PPC?) and try the build on that.

<pre class="smallexample">     $  bunzip2 &lt; gdb-5.2.tar.bz2 | tar xpf -

   <h4 class="subsection">19.6.3 Make a release candidate available</h4>

<p>If this is a release candidate then the only remaining steps are:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Commit <samp><span class="file">version.in</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Shadow the pages onto gnu</h5>

<p>Something goes here.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Install the <span class="sc">gdb</span> tar ball on GNU</h5>

<p>At the time of writing, the GNU machine was <kbd>gnudist.gnu.org</kbd> in
<samp><span class="file">~ftp/gnu/gdb</span></samp>.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Make the <samp><span class="file">ANNOUNCEMENT</span></samp></h5>

<p>Post the <samp><span class="file">ANNOUNCEMENT</span></samp> file you created above to:

     <ul>
<li><a href="mailto:gdb-announce@sources.redhat.com">GDB Announcement mailing list</a>
<li><a href="mailto:info-gnu@gnu.org">General GNU Announcement list</a> (but delay it a
day or so to let things get out)
<li><a href="mailto:bug-gdb@gnu.org">GDB Bug Report mailing list</a>
</ul>

<h4 class="subsection">19.6.5 Cleanup</h4>

<p>The release is out but you're still not finished.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Commit outstanding changes</h5>

<p>In particular you'll need to commit any changes to:

     <ul>
<li><samp><span class="file">gdb/ChangeLog</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="file">gdb/version.in</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="file">gdb/NEWS</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="file">gdb/README</span></samp>
</ul>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Tag the release</h5>

<p>Something like:

<pre class="smallexample">     $  d=`date -u +%Y-%m-%d`
     $  echo $d
     2002-01-24
     $  ( cd insight/src/gdb &amp;&amp; cvs -f -q update )
     $  ( cd insight/src &amp;&amp; cvs -f -q tag gdb_5_2-$d-release )
</pre>
   <p>Insight is used since that contains more of the release than
<span class="sc">gdb</span>.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Mention the release on the trunk</h5>

<p>Just put something in the <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> so that the trunk also
indicates when the release was made.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Restart <samp><span class="file">gdb/version.in</span></samp></h5>

<p>If <samp><span class="file">gdb/version.in</span></samp> does not contain an ISO date such as
<kbd>2002-01-24</kbd> then the daily <code>cronjob</code> won't update it.  Having
committed all the release changes it can be set to
<samp><span class="file">5.2.0_0000-00-00-cvs</span></samp> which will restart things (yes the <kbd>_</kbd>
is important - it affects the snapshot process).

   <p>Don't forget the <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp>.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Merge into trunk</h5>

<p>The files committed to the branch may also need changes merged into the
trunk.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Revise the release schedule</h5>

<p>Post a revised release schedule to <a href="mailto:gdb@sources.redhat.com">GDB Discussion List</a> with an updated announcement.  The schedule can be
generated by running:

<pre class="smallexample">     $  ~/ss/schedule `date +%s` schedule
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first parameter is approximate date/time in seconds (from the epoch)
of the most recent release.

   <p>Also update the schedule <code>cronjob</code>.

<h3 class="section">19.7 Post release</h3>

<p>Remove any <code>OBSOLETE</code> code.
