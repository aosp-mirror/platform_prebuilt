<h2 class="chapter">2 Overall Structure</h2>

<p><span class="sc">gdb</span> consists of three major subsystems: user interface,
symbol handling (the <dfn>symbol side</dfn>), and target system handling (the
<dfn>target side</dfn>).

   <p>The user interface consists of several actual interfaces, plus
supporting code.

   <p>The symbol side consists of object file readers, debugging info
interpreters, symbol table management, source language expression
parsing, type and value printing.

   <p>The target side consists of execution control, stack frame analysis, and
physical target manipulation.

   <p>The target side/symbol side division is not formal, and there are a
number of exceptions.  For instance, core file support involves symbolic
elements (the basic core file reader is in BFD) and target elements (it
supplies the contents of memory and the values of registers).  Instead,
this division is useful for understanding how the minor subsystems
should fit together.

<h3 class="section">2.1 The Symbol Side</h3>

<p>The symbolic side of <span class="sc">gdb</span> can be thought of as &ldquo;everything
you can do in <span class="sc">gdb</span> without having a live program running&rdquo;. 
For instance, you can look at the types of variables, and evaluate
many kinds of expressions.

<h3 class="section">2.2 The Target Side</h3>

<p>The target side of <span class="sc">gdb</span> is the &ldquo;bits and bytes manipulator&rdquo;. 
Although it may make reference to symbolic info here and there, most
of the target side will run with only a stripped executable
available&mdash;or even no executable at all, in remote debugging cases.

   <p>Operations such as disassembly, stack frame crawls, and register
display, are able to work with no symbolic info at all.  In some cases,
such as disassembly, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will use symbolic info to present addresses
relative to symbols rather than as raw numbers, but it will work either
way.

<h3 class="section">2.3 Configurations</h3>

<p><a name="index-host-2"></a><a name="index-target-3"></a><dfn>Host</dfn> refers to attributes of the system where <span class="sc">gdb</span> runs. 
<dfn>Target</dfn> refers to the system where the program being debugged
executes.  In most cases they are the same machine, in which case a
third type of <dfn>Native</dfn> attributes come into play.

   <p>Defines and include files needed to build on the host are host
support.  Examples are tty support, system defined types, host byte
order, host float format.  These are all calculated by <code>autoconf</code>
when the debugger is built.

   <p>Defines and information needed to handle the target format are target
dependent.  Examples are the stack frame format, instruction set,
breakpoint instruction, registers, and how to set up and tear down the stack
to call a function.

   <p>Information that is only needed when the host and target are the same,
is native dependent.  One example is Unix child process support; if the
host and target are not the same, calling <code>fork</code> to start the target
process is a bad idea.  The various macros needed for finding the
registers in the <code>upage</code>, running <code>ptrace</code>, and such are all
in the native-dependent files.

   <p>Another example of native-dependent code is support for features that
are really part of the target environment, but which require
<code>#include</code> files that are only available on the host system.  Core
file handling and <code>setjmp</code> handling are two common cases.

   <p>When you want to make <span class="sc">gdb</span> work as the traditional native debugger
on a system, you will need to supply both target and native information.

<h3 class="section">2.4 Source Tree Structure</h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040value_007bGDBN_007d-source-tree-structure-4"></a>
The <span class="sc">gdb</span> source directory has a mostly flat structure&mdash;there
are only a few subdirectories.  A file's name usually gives a hint as
to what it does; for example, <samp><span class="file">stabsread.c</span></samp> reads stabs,
<samp><span class="file">dwarf2read.c</span></samp> reads <span class="sc">DWARF 2</span>, etc.

   <p>Files that are related to some common task have names that share
common substrings.  For example, <samp><span class="file">*-thread.c</span></samp> files deal with
debugging threads on various platforms; <samp><span class="file">*read.c</span></samp> files deal with
reading various kinds of symbol and object files; <samp><span class="file">inf*.c</span></samp> files
deal with direct control of the <dfn>inferior program</dfn> (<span class="sc">gdb</span>
parlance for the program being debugged).

   <p>There are several dozens of files in the <samp><span class="file">*-tdep.c</span></samp> family. 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tdep</span></samp>&rsquo; stands for <dfn>target-dependent code</dfn>&mdash;each of these
files implements debug support for a specific target architecture
(sparc, mips, etc).  Usually, only one of these will be used in a
specific <span class="sc">gdb</span> configuration (sometimes two, closely related).

   <p>Similarly, there are many <samp><span class="file">*-nat.c</span></samp> files, each one for native
debugging on a specific system (e.g., <samp><span class="file">sparc-linux-nat.c</span></samp> is for
native debugging of Sparc machines running the Linux kernel).

   <p>The few subdirectories of the source tree are:

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="file">cli</span></samp><dd>Code that implements <dfn>CLI</dfn>, the <span class="sc">gdb</span> Command-Line
Interpreter.  See <a href="User-Interface.html#User-Interface">Command Interpreter</a>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">gdbserver</span></samp><dd>Code for the <span class="sc">gdb</span> remote server.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">gdbtk</span></samp><dd>Code for Insight, the <span class="sc">gdb</span> TK-based GUI front-end.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">mi</span></samp><dd>The <dfn>GDB/MI</dfn>, the <span class="sc">gdb</span> Machine Interface interpreter.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">signals</span></samp><dd>Target signal translation code.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">tui</span></samp><dd>Code for <dfn>TUI</dfn>, the <span class="sc">gdb</span> Text-mode full-screen User
Interface.  See <a href="User-Interface.html#User-Interface">TUI</a>.
