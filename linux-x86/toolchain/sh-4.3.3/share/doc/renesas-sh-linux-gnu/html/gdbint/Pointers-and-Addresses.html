<h3 class="section">10.4 Pointers Are Not Always Addresses</h3>

<p><a name="index-pointer-representation-226"></a><a name="index-address-representation-227"></a><a name="index-word_002daddressed-machines-228"></a><a name="index-separate-data-and-code-address-spaces-229"></a><a name="index-spaces_002c-separate-data-and-code-address-230"></a><a name="index-address-spaces_002c-separate-data-and-code-231"></a><a name="index-code-pointers_002c-word_002daddressed-232"></a><a name="index-converting-between-pointers-and-addresses-233"></a><a name="index-D10V-addresses-234"></a>
On almost all 32-bit architectures, the representation of a pointer is
indistinguishable from the representation of some fixed-length number
whose value is the byte address of the object pointed to.  On such
machines, the words &ldquo;pointer&rdquo; and &ldquo;address&rdquo; can be used interchangeably. 
However, architectures with smaller word sizes are often cramped for
address space, so they may choose a pointer representation that breaks this
identity, and allows a larger code address space.

<!-- D10V is gone from sources - more current example? -->
   <p>For example, the Renesas D10V is a 16-bit VLIW processor whose
instructions are 32 bits long<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. 
If the D10V used ordinary byte addresses to refer to code locations,
then the processor would only be able to address 64kb of instructions. 
However, since instructions must be aligned on four-byte boundaries, the
low two bits of any valid instruction's byte address are always
zero&mdash;byte addresses waste two bits.  So instead of byte addresses,
the D10V uses word addresses&mdash;byte addresses shifted right two bits&mdash;to
refer to code.  Thus, the D10V can use 16-bit words to address 256kb of
code space.

   <p>However, this means that code pointers and data pointers have different
forms on the D10V.  The 16-bit word <code>0xC020</code> refers to byte address
<code>0xC020</code> when used as a data address, but refers to byte address
<code>0x30080</code> when used as a code address.

   <p>(The D10V also uses separate code and data address spaces, which also
affects the correspondence between pointers and addresses, but we're
going to ignore that here; this example is already too long.)

   <p>To cope with architectures like this&mdash;the D10V is not the only
one!&mdash;<span class="sc">gdb</span> tries to distinguish between <dfn>addresses</dfn>, which are
byte numbers, and <dfn>pointers</dfn>, which are the target's representation
of an address of a particular type of data.  In the example above,
<code>0xC020</code> is the pointer, which refers to one of the addresses
<code>0xC020</code> or <code>0x30080</code>, depending on the type imposed upon it. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> provides functions for turning a pointer into an address
and vice versa, in the appropriate way for the current architecture.

   <p>Unfortunately, since addresses and pointers are identical on almost all
processors, this distinction tends to bit-rot pretty quickly.  Thus,
each time you port <span class="sc">gdb</span> to an architecture which does
distinguish between pointers and addresses, you'll probably need to
clean up some architecture-independent code.

   <p>Here are functions which convert between pointers and addresses:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: CORE_ADDR <b>extract_typed_address</b> (<var>void *buf, struct type *type</var>)<var><a name="index-extract_005ftyped_005faddress-235"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Treat the bytes at <var>buf</var> as a pointer or reference of type
<var>type</var>, and return the address it represents, in a manner
appropriate for the current architecture.  This yields an address
<span class="sc">gdb</span> can use to read target memory, disassemble, etc.  Note that
<var>buf</var> refers to a buffer in <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s memory, not the
inferior's.

        <p>For example, if the current architecture is the Intel x86, this function
extracts a little-endian integer of the appropriate length from
<var>buf</var> and returns it.  However, if the current architecture is the
D10V, this function will return a 16-bit integer extracted from
<var>buf</var>, multiplied by four if <var>type</var> is a pointer to a function.

        <p>If <var>type</var> is not a pointer or reference type, then this function
will signal an internal error. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: CORE_ADDR <b>store_typed_address</b> (<var>void *buf, struct type *type, CORE_ADDR addr</var>)<var><a name="index-store_005ftyped_005faddress-236"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Store the address <var>addr</var> in <var>buf</var>, in the proper format for a
pointer of type <var>type</var> in the current architecture.  Note that
<var>buf</var> refers to a buffer in <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s memory, not the
inferior's.

        <p>For example, if the current architecture is the Intel x86, this function
stores <var>addr</var> unmodified as a little-endian integer of the
appropriate length in <var>buf</var>.  However, if the current architecture
is the D10V, this function divides <var>addr</var> by four if <var>type</var> is
a pointer to a function, and then stores it in <var>buf</var>.

        <p>If <var>type</var> is not a pointer or reference type, then this function
will signal an internal error. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: CORE_ADDR <b>value_as_address</b> (<var>struct value *val</var>)<var><a name="index-value_005fas_005faddress-237"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Assuming that <var>val</var> is a pointer, return the address it represents,
as appropriate for the current architecture.

        <p>This function actually works on integral values, as well as pointers. 
For pointers, it performs architecture-specific conversions as
described above for <code>extract_typed_address</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: CORE_ADDR <b>value_from_pointer</b> (<var>struct type *type, CORE_ADDR addr</var>)<var><a name="index-value_005ffrom_005fpointer-238"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Create and return a value representing a pointer of type <var>type</var> to
the address <var>addr</var>, as appropriate for the current architecture. 
This function performs architecture-specific conversions as described
above for <code>store_typed_address</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Here are two functions which architectures can define to indicate the
relationship between pointers and addresses.  These have default
definitions, appropriate for architectures on which all pointers are
simple unsigned byte addresses.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: CORE_ADDR <b>gdbarch_pointer_to_address</b> (<var>struct gdbarch *current_gdbarch, struct type *type, char *buf</var>)<var><a name="index-gdbarch_005fpointer_005fto_005faddress-239"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Assume that <var>buf</var> holds a pointer of type <var>type</var>, in the
appropriate format for the current architecture.  Return the byte
address the pointer refers to.

        <p>This function may safely assume that <var>type</var> is either a pointer or a
C<tt>++</tt> reference type. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: void <b>gdbarch_address_to_pointer</b> (<var>struct gdbarch *current_gdbarch, struct type *type, char *buf, CORE_ADDR addr</var>)<var><a name="index-gdbarch_005faddress_005fto_005fpointer-240"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Store in <var>buf</var> a pointer of type <var>type</var> representing the address
<var>addr</var>, in the appropriate format for the current architecture.

        <p>This function may safely assume that <var>type</var> is either a pointer or a
C<tt>++</tt> reference type. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> Some D10V instructions are
actually pairs of 16-bit sub-instructions.  However, since you can't
jump into the middle of such a pair, code addresses can only refer to
full 32 bit instructions, which is what matters in this explanation.</p>
