<h2 class="chapter">7 Symbol Handling</h2>

<p>Symbols are a key part of <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s operation.  Symbols include
variables, functions, and types.

   <p>Symbol information for a large program can be truly massive, and
reading of symbol information is one of the major performance
bottlenecks in <span class="sc">gdb</span>; it can take many minutes to process it
all.  Studies have shown that nearly all the time spent is
computational, rather than file reading.

   <p>One of the ways for <span class="sc">gdb</span> to provide a good user experience is
to start up quickly, taking no more than a few seconds.  It is simply
not possible to process all of a program's debugging info in that
time, and so we attempt to handle symbols incrementally.  For instance,
we create <dfn>partial symbol tables</dfn> consisting of only selected
symbols, and only expand them to full symbol tables when necessary.

<h3 class="section">7.1 Symbol Reading</h3>

<p><a name="index-symbol-reading-121"></a><a name="index-reading-of-symbols-122"></a><a name="index-symbol-files-123"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> reads symbols from <dfn>symbol files</dfn>.  The usual symbol
file is the file containing the program which <span class="sc">gdb</span> is
debugging.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> can be directed to use a different file for
symbols (with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">symbol-file</span></samp>&rsquo; command), and it can also read
more symbols via the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">add-file</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">load</span></samp>&rsquo; commands. In
addition, it may bring in more symbols while loading shared
libraries.

   <p><a name="index-find_005fsym_005ffns-124"></a>Symbol files are initially opened by code in <samp><span class="file">symfile.c</span></samp> using
the BFD library (see <a href="Support-Libraries.html#Support-Libraries">Support Libraries</a>).  BFD identifies the type
of the file by examining its header.  <code>find_sym_fns</code> then uses
this identification to locate a set of symbol-reading functions.

   <p><a name="index-add_005fsymtab_005ffns-125"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bsym_005ffns_007d-structure-126"></a><a name="index-adding-a-symbol_002dreading-module-127"></a>Symbol-reading modules identify themselves to <span class="sc">gdb</span> by calling
<code>add_symtab_fns</code> during their module initialization.  The argument
to <code>add_symtab_fns</code> is a <code>struct sym_fns</code> which contains the
name (or name prefix) of the symbol format, the length of the prefix,
and pointers to four functions.  These functions are called at various
times to process symbol files whose identification matches the specified
prefix.

   <p>The functions supplied by each module are:

     <dl>
<dt><var>xyz</var><code>_symfile_init(struct sym_fns *sf)</code><dd>
<a name="index-secondary-symbol-file-128"></a>Called from <code>symbol_file_add</code> when we are about to read a new
symbol file.  This function should clean up any internal state (possibly
resulting from half-read previous files, for example) and prepare to
read a new symbol file.  Note that the symbol file which we are reading
might be a new &ldquo;main&rdquo; symbol file, or might be a secondary symbol file
whose symbols are being added to the existing symbol table.

     <p>The argument to <var>xyz</var><code>_symfile_init</code> is a newly allocated
<code>struct sym_fns</code> whose <code>bfd</code> field contains the BFD for the
new symbol file being read.  Its <code>private</code> field has been zeroed,
and can be modified as desired.  Typically, a struct of private
information will be <code>malloc</code>'d, and a pointer to it will be placed
in the <code>private</code> field.

     <p>There is no result from <var>xyz</var><code>_symfile_init</code>, but it can call
<code>error</code> if it detects an unavoidable problem.

     <br><dt><var>xyz</var><code>_new_init()</code><dd>
Called from <code>symbol_file_add</code> when discarding existing symbols. 
This function needs only handle the symbol-reading module's internal
state; the symbol table data structures visible to the rest of
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will be discarded by <code>symbol_file_add</code>.  It has no
arguments and no result.  It may be called after
<var>xyz</var><code>_symfile_init</code>, if a new symbol table is being read, or
may be called alone if all symbols are simply being discarded.

     <br><dt><var>xyz</var><code>_symfile_read(struct sym_fns *sf, CORE_ADDR addr, int mainline)</code><dd>
Called from <code>symbol_file_add</code> to actually read the symbols from a
symbol-file into a set of psymtabs or symtabs.

     <p><code>sf</code> points to the <code>struct sym_fns</code> originally passed to
<var>xyz</var><code>_sym_init</code> for possible initialization.  <code>addr</code> is
the offset between the file's specified start address and its true
address in memory.  <code>mainline</code> is 1 if this is the main symbol
table being read, and 0 if a secondary symbol file (e.g., shared library
or dynamically loaded file) is being read. 
</dl>

   <p>In addition, if a symbol-reading module creates psymtabs when
<var>xyz</var>_symfile_read is called, these psymtabs will contain a pointer
to a function <var>xyz</var><code>_psymtab_to_symtab</code>, which can be called
from any point in the <span class="sc">gdb</span> symbol-handling code.

     <dl>
<dt><var>xyz</var><code>_psymtab_to_symtab (struct partial_symtab *pst)</code><dd>
Called from <code>psymtab_to_symtab</code> (or the <code>PSYMTAB_TO_SYMTAB</code> macro) if
the psymtab has not already been read in and had its <code>pst-&gt;symtab</code>
pointer set.  The argument is the psymtab to be fleshed-out into a
symtab.  Upon return, <code>pst-&gt;readin</code> should have been set to 1, and
<code>pst-&gt;symtab</code> should contain a pointer to the new corresponding symtab, or
zero if there were no symbols in that part of the symbol file. 
</dl>

<h3 class="section">7.2 Partial Symbol Tables</h3>

<p><span class="sc">gdb</span> has three types of symbol tables:

     
<a name="index-full-symbol-table-129"></a>
<a name="index-symtabs-130"></a>
<ul><li>Full symbol tables (<dfn>symtabs</dfn>).  These contain the main
information about symbols and addresses.

     <p><a name="index-psymtabs-131"></a><li>Partial symbol tables (<dfn>psymtabs</dfn>).  These contain enough
information to know when to read the corresponding part of the full
symbol table.

     <p><a name="index-minimal-symbol-table-132"></a><a name="index-minsymtabs-133"></a><li>Minimal symbol tables (<dfn>msymtabs</dfn>).  These contain information
gleaned from non-debugging symbols. 
</ul>

   <p><a name="index-partial-symbol-table-134"></a>This section describes partial symbol tables.

   <p>A psymtab is constructed by doing a very quick pass over an executable
file's debugging information.  Small amounts of information are
extracted&mdash;enough to identify which parts of the symbol table will
need to be re-read and fully digested later, when the user needs the
information.  The speed of this pass causes <span class="sc">gdb</span> to start up very
quickly.  Later, as the detailed rereading occurs, it occurs in small
pieces, at various times, and the delay therefrom is mostly invisible to
the user. 
<!-- (@xref{Symbol Reading}.) -->

   <p>The symbols that show up in a file's psymtab should be, roughly, those
visible to the debugger's user when the program is not running code from
that file.  These include external symbols and types, static symbols and
types, and <code>enum</code> values declared at file scope.

   <p>The psymtab also contains the range of instruction addresses that the
full symbol table would represent.

   <p><a name="index-finding-a-symbol-135"></a><a name="index-symbol-lookup-136"></a>The idea is that there are only two ways for the user (or much of the
code in the debugger) to reference a symbol:

     
<a name="index-find_005fpc_005ffunction-137"></a>
<a name="index-find_005fpc_005fline-138"></a>
<ul><li>By its address (e.g., execution stops at some address which is inside a
function in this file).  The address will be noticed to be in the
range of this psymtab, and the full symtab will be read in. 
<code>find_pc_function</code>, <code>find_pc_line</code>, and other
<code>find_pc_...</code> functions handle this.

     <p><a name="index-lookup_005fsymbol-139"></a><li>By its name
(e.g., the user asks to print a variable, or set a breakpoint on a
function).  Global names and file-scope names will be found in the
psymtab, which will cause the symtab to be pulled in.  Local names will
have to be qualified by a global name, or a file-scope name, in which
case we will have already read in the symtab as we evaluated the
qualifier.  Or, a local symbol can be referenced when we are &ldquo;in&rdquo; a
local scope, in which case the first case applies.  <code>lookup_symbol</code>
does most of the work here. 
</ul>

   <p>The only reason that psymtabs exist is to cause a symtab to be read in
at the right moment.  Any symbol that can be elided from a psymtab,
while still causing that to happen, should not appear in it.  Since
psymtabs don't have the idea of scope, you can't put local symbols in
them anyway.  Psymtabs don't have the idea of the type of a symbol,
either, so types need not appear, unless they will be referenced by
name.

   <p>It is a bug for <span class="sc">gdb</span> to behave one way when only a psymtab has
been read, and another way if the corresponding symtab has been read
in.  Such bugs are typically caused by a psymtab that does not contain
all the visible symbols, or which has the wrong instruction address
ranges.

   <p>The psymtab for a particular section of a symbol file (objfile) could be
thrown away after the symtab has been read in.  The symtab should always
be searched before the psymtab, so the psymtab will never be used (in a
bug-free environment).  Currently, psymtabs are allocated on an obstack,
and all the psymbols themselves are allocated in a pair of large arrays
on an obstack, so there is little to be gained by trying to free them
unless you want to do a lot more work.

<h3 class="section">7.3 Types</h3>

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Fundamental Types (e.g., <code>FT_VOID</code>, <code>FT_BOOLEAN</code>).</h4>

<p><a name="index-fundamental-types-140"></a>These are the fundamental types that <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses internally.  Fundamental
types from the various debugging formats (stabs, ELF, etc) are mapped
into one of these.  They are basically a union of all fundamental types
that <span class="sc">gdb</span> knows about for all the languages that <span class="sc">gdb</span>
knows about.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Type Codes (e.g., <code>TYPE_CODE_PTR</code>, <code>TYPE_CODE_ARRAY</code>).</h4>

<p><a name="index-type-codes-141"></a>Each time <span class="sc">gdb</span> builds an internal type, it marks it with one
of these types.  The type may be a fundamental type, such as
<code>TYPE_CODE_INT</code>, or a derived type, such as <code>TYPE_CODE_PTR</code>
which is a pointer to another type.  Typically, several <code>FT_*</code>
types map to one <code>TYPE_CODE_*</code> type, and are distinguished by
other members of the type struct, such as whether the type is signed
or unsigned, and how many bits it uses.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Builtin Types (e.g., <code>builtin_type_void</code>, <code>builtin_type_char</code>).</h4>

<p>These are instances of type structs that roughly correspond to
fundamental types and are created as global types for <span class="sc">gdb</span> to
use for various ugly historical reasons.  We eventually want to
eliminate these.  Note for example that <code>builtin_type_int</code>
initialized in <samp><span class="file">gdbtypes.c</span></samp> is basically the same as a
<code>TYPE_CODE_INT</code> type that is initialized in <samp><span class="file">c-lang.c</span></samp> for
an <code>FT_INTEGER</code> fundamental type.  The difference is that the
<code>builtin_type</code> is not associated with any particular objfile, and
only one instance exists, while <samp><span class="file">c-lang.c</span></samp> builds as many
<code>TYPE_CODE_INT</code> types as needed, with each one associated with
some particular objfile.

<h3 class="section">7.4 Object File Formats</h3>

<p><a name="index-object-file-formats-142"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">7.4.1 a.out</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007ba_002eout_007d-format-143"></a>The <code>a.out</code> format is the original file format for Unix.  It
consists of three sections: <code>text</code>, <code>data</code>, and <code>bss</code>,
which are for program code, initialized data, and uninitialized data,
respectively.

   <p>The <code>a.out</code> format is so simple that it doesn't have any reserved
place for debugging information.  (Hey, the original Unix hackers used
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">adb</span></samp>&rsquo;, which is a machine-language debugger!)  The only debugging
format for <code>a.out</code> is stabs, which is encoded as a set of normal
symbols with distinctive attributes.

   <p>The basic <code>a.out</code> reader is in <samp><span class="file">dbxread.c</span></samp>.

<h4 class="subsection">7.4.2 COFF</h4>

<p><a name="index-COFF-format-144"></a>The COFF format was introduced with System V Release 3 (SVR3) Unix. 
COFF files may have multiple sections, each prefixed by a header.  The
number of sections is limited.

   <p>The COFF specification includes support for debugging.  Although this
was a step forward, the debugging information was woefully limited. 
For instance, it was not possible to represent code that came from an
included file.  GNU's COFF-using configs often use stabs-type info,
encapsulated in special sections.

   <p>The COFF reader is in <samp><span class="file">coffread.c</span></samp>.

<h4 class="subsection">7.4.3 ECOFF</h4>

<p><a name="index-ECOFF-format-145"></a>ECOFF is an extended COFF originally introduced for Mips and Alpha
workstations.

   <p>The basic ECOFF reader is in <samp><span class="file">mipsread.c</span></samp>.

<h4 class="subsection">7.4.4 XCOFF</h4>

<p><a name="index-XCOFF-format-146"></a>The IBM RS/6000 running AIX uses an object file format called XCOFF. 
The COFF sections, symbols, and line numbers are used, but debugging
symbols are <code>dbx</code>-style stabs whose strings are located in the
<code>.debug</code> section (rather than the string table).  For more
information, see <a href="../stabs/index.html#Top">Top</a>.

   <p>The shared library scheme has a clean interface for figuring out what
shared libraries are in use, but the catch is that everything which
refers to addresses (symbol tables and breakpoints at least) needs to be
relocated for both shared libraries and the main executable.  At least
using the standard mechanism this can only be done once the program has
been run (or the core file has been read).

<h4 class="subsection">7.4.5 PE</h4>

<p><a name="index-PE_002dCOFF-format-147"></a>Windows 95 and NT use the PE (<dfn>Portable Executable</dfn>) format for their
executables.  PE is basically COFF with additional headers.

   <p>While BFD includes special PE support, <span class="sc">gdb</span> needs only the basic
COFF reader.

<h4 class="subsection">7.4.6 ELF</h4>

<p><a name="index-ELF-format-148"></a>The ELF format came with System V Release 4 (SVR4) Unix.  ELF is
similar to COFF in being organized into a number of sections, but it
removes many of COFF's limitations.  Debugging info may be either stabs
encapsulated in ELF sections, or more commonly these days, DWARF.

   <p>The basic ELF reader is in <samp><span class="file">elfread.c</span></samp>.

<h4 class="subsection">7.4.7 SOM</h4>

<p><a name="index-SOM-format-149"></a>SOM is HP's object file and debug format (not to be confused with IBM's
SOM, which is a cross-language ABI).

   <p>The SOM reader is in <samp><span class="file">somread.c</span></samp>.

<h3 class="section">7.5 Debugging File Formats</h3>

<p>This section describes characteristics of debugging information that
are independent of the object file format.

<h4 class="subsection">7.5.1 stabs</h4>

<p><a name="index-stabs-debugging-info-150"></a><code>stabs</code> started out as special symbols within the <code>a.out</code>
format.  Since then, it has been encapsulated into other file
formats, such as COFF and ELF.

   <p>While <samp><span class="file">dbxread.c</span></samp> does some of the basic stab processing,
including for encapsulated versions, <samp><span class="file">stabsread.c</span></samp> does
the real work.

<h4 class="subsection">7.5.2 COFF</h4>

<p><a name="index-COFF-debugging-info-151"></a>The basic COFF definition includes debugging information.  The level
of support is minimal and non-extensible, and is not often used.

<h4 class="subsection">7.5.3 Mips debug (Third Eye)</h4>

<p><a name="index-ECOFF-debugging-info-152"></a>ECOFF includes a definition of a special debug format.

   <p>The file <samp><span class="file">mdebugread.c</span></samp> implements reading for this format.

<!-- mention DWARF 1 as a formerly-supported format -->
<h4 class="subsection">7.5.4 DWARF 2</h4>

<p><a name="index-DWARF-2-debugging-info-153"></a>DWARF 2 is an improved but incompatible version of DWARF 1.

   <p>The DWARF 2 reader is in <samp><span class="file">dwarf2read.c</span></samp>.

<h4 class="subsection">7.5.5 Compressed DWARF 2</h4>

<p><a name="index-Compressed-DWARF-2-debugging-info-154"></a>Compressed DWARF 2 is not technically a separate debugging format, but
merely DWARF 2 debug information that has been compressed.  In this
format, every object-file section holding DWARF 2 debugging
information is compressed and prepended with a header.  (The section
is also typically renamed, so a section called <code>.debug_info</code> in a
DWARF 2 binary would be called <code>.zdebug_info</code> in a compressed
DWARF 2 binary.)  The header is 12 bytes long:

     <ul>
<li>4 bytes: the literal string &ldquo;ZLIB&rdquo;
<li>8 bytes: the uncompressed size of the section, in big-endian byte
order. 
</ul>

   <p>The same reader is used for both compressed an normal DWARF 2 info. 
Section decompression is done in <code>zlib_decompress_section</code> in
<samp><span class="file">dwarf2read.c</span></samp>.

<h4 class="subsection">7.5.6 DWARF 3</h4>

<p><a name="index-DWARF-3-debugging-info-155"></a>DWARF 3 is an improved version of DWARF 2.

<h4 class="subsection">7.5.7 SOM</h4>

<p><a name="index-SOM-debugging-info-156"></a>Like COFF, the SOM definition includes debugging information.

<h3 class="section">7.6 Adding a New Symbol Reader to <span class="sc">gdb</span></h3>

<p><a name="index-adding-debugging-info-reader-157"></a>If you are using an existing object file format (<code>a.out</code>, COFF, ELF, etc),
there is probably little to be done.

   <p>If you need to add a new object file format, you must first add it to
BFD.  This is beyond the scope of this document.

   <p>You must then arrange for the BFD code to provide access to the
debugging symbols.  Generally <span class="sc">gdb</span> will have to call swapping
routines from BFD and a few other BFD internal routines to locate the
debugging information.  As much as possible, <span class="sc">gdb</span> should not
depend on the BFD internal data structures.

   <p>For some targets (e.g., COFF), there is a special transfer vector used
to call swapping routines, since the external data structures on various
platforms have different sizes and layouts.  Specialized routines that
will only ever be implemented by one object file format may be called
directly.  This interface should be described in a file
<samp><span class="file">bfd/lib</span><var>xyz</var><span class="file">.h</span></samp>, which is included by <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

<h3 class="section">7.7 Memory Management for Symbol Files</h3>

<p>Most memory associated with a loaded symbol file is stored on
its <code>objfile_obstack</code>.  This includes symbols, types,
namespace data, and other information produced by the symbol readers.

   <p>Because this data lives on the objfile's obstack, it is automatically
released when the objfile is unloaded or reloaded.  Therefore one
objfile must not reference symbol or type data from another objfile;
they could be unloaded at different times.

   <p>User convenience variables, et cetera, have associated types.  Normally
these types live in the associated objfile.  However, when the objfile
is unloaded, those types are deep copied to global memory, so that
the values of the user variables and history items are not lost.
