<h2 class="chapter">1 Requirements</h2>

<p><a name="index-requirements-for-_0040value_007bGDBN_007d-1"></a>
Before diving into the internals, you should understand the formal
requirements and other expectations for <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  Although some
of these may seem obvious, there have been proposals for <span class="sc">gdb</span>
that have run counter to these requirements.

   <p>First of all, <span class="sc">gdb</span> is a debugger.  It's not designed to be a
front panel for embedded systems.  It's not a text editor.  It's not a
shell.  It's not a programming environment.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> is an interactive tool.  Although a batch mode is
available, <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s primary role is to interact with a human
programmer.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> should be responsive to the user.  A programmer hot on
the trail of a nasty bug, and operating under a looming deadline, is
going to be very impatient of everything, including the response time
to debugger commands.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> should be relatively permissive, such as for expressions. 
While the compiler should be picky (or have the option to be made
picky), since source code lives for a long time usually, the
programmer doing debugging shouldn't be spending time figuring out to
mollify the debugger.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> will be called upon to deal with really large programs. 
Executable sizes of 50 to 100 megabytes occur regularly, and we've
heard reports of programs approaching 1 gigabyte in size.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> should be able to run everywhere.  No other debugger is
available for even half as many configurations as <span class="sc">gdb</span>
supports.
