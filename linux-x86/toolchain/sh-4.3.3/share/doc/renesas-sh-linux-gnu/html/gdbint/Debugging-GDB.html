<h3 class="section">21.2 Debugging <span class="sc">gdb</span> with itself</h3>

<p><a name="index-debugging-_0040value_007bGDBN_007d-433"></a>
If <span class="sc">gdb</span> is limping on your machine, this is the preferred way to get it
fully functional.  Be warned that in some ancient Unix systems, like
Ultrix 4.2, a program can't be running in one process while it is being
debugged in another.  Rather than typing the command <kbd>./gdb&nbsp;./gdb<!-- /@w --></kbd>, which works on Suns and such, you can copy <samp><span class="file">gdb</span></samp> to
<samp><span class="file">gdb2</span></samp> and then type <kbd>./gdb&nbsp;./gdb2<!-- /@w --></kbd>.

   <p>When you run <span class="sc">gdb</span> in the <span class="sc">gdb</span> source directory, it will read a
<samp><span class="file">.gdbinit</span></samp> file that sets up some simple things to make debugging
gdb easier.  The <code>info</code> command, when executed without a subcommand
in a <span class="sc">gdb</span> being debugged by gdb, will pop you back up to the top level
gdb.  See <samp><span class="file">.gdbinit</span></samp> for details.

   <p>If you use emacs, you will probably want to do a <code>make TAGS</code> after
you configure your distribution; this will put the machine dependent
routines for your local machine where they will be accessed first by
<kbd>M-.</kbd>

   <p>Also, make sure that you've either compiled <span class="sc">gdb</span> with your local cc, or
have run <code>fixincludes</code> if you are compiling with gcc.

<h3 class="section">21.3 Submitting Patches</h3>

<p><a name="index-submitting-patches-434"></a>Thanks for thinking of offering your changes back to the community of
<span class="sc">gdb</span> users.  In general we like to get well designed enhancements. 
Thanks also for checking in advance about the best way to transfer the
changes.

   <p>The <span class="sc">gdb</span> maintainers will only install &ldquo;cleanly designed&rdquo; patches. 
This manual summarizes what we believe to be clean design for <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

   <p>If the maintainers don't have time to put the patch in when it arrives,
or if there is any question about a patch, it goes into a large queue
with everyone else's patches and bug reports.

   <p><a name="index-legal-papers-for-code-contributions-435"></a>The legal issue is that to incorporate substantial changes requires a
copyright assignment from you and/or your employer, granting ownership
of the changes to the Free Software Foundation.  You can get the
standard documents for doing this by sending mail to <code>gnu@gnu.org</code>
and asking for it.  We recommend that people write in "All programs
owned by the Free Software Foundation" as "NAME OF PROGRAM", so that
changes in many programs (not just <span class="sc">gdb</span>, but GAS, Emacs, GCC,
etc) can be
contributed with only one piece of legalese pushed through the
bureaucracy and filed with the FSF.  We can't start merging changes until
this paperwork is received by the FSF (their rules, which we follow
since we maintain it for them).

   <p>Technically, the easiest way to receive changes is to receive each
feature as a small context diff or unidiff, suitable for <code>patch</code>. 
Each message sent to me should include the changes to C code and
header files for a single feature, plus <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> entries for
each directory where files were modified, and diffs for any changes
needed to the manuals (<samp><span class="file">gdb/doc/gdb.texinfo</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="file">gdb/doc/gdbint.texinfo</span></samp>).  If there are a lot of changes for a
single feature, they can be split down into multiple messages.

   <p>In this way, if we read and like the feature, we can add it to the
sources with a single patch command, do some testing, and check it in. 
If you leave out the <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp>, we have to write one.  If you leave
out the doc, we have to puzzle out what needs documenting.  Etc., etc.

   <p>The reason to send each change in a separate message is that we will not
install some of the changes.  They'll be returned to you with questions
or comments.  If we're doing our job correctly, the message back to you
will say what you have to fix in order to make the change acceptable. 
The reason to have separate messages for separate features is so that
the acceptable changes can be installed while one or more changes are
being reworked.  If multiple features are sent in a single message, we
tend to not put in the effort to sort out the acceptable changes from
the unacceptable, so none of the features get installed until all are
acceptable.

   <p>If this sounds painful or authoritarian, well, it is.  But we get a lot
of bug reports and a lot of patches, and many of them don't get
installed because we don't have the time to finish the job that the bug
reporter or the contributor could have done.  Patches that arrive
complete, working, and well designed, tend to get installed on the day
they arrive.  The others go into a queue and get installed as time
permits, which, since the maintainers have many demands to meet, may not
be for quite some time.

   <p>Please send patches directly to
<a href="mailto:gdb-patches@sources.redhat.com">the <span class="sc">gdb</span> maintainers</a>.

<h3 class="section">21.4 Build Script</h3>

<p><a name="index-build-script-436"></a>
The script <samp><span class="file">gdb_buildall.sh</span></samp> builds <span class="sc">gdb</span> with flag
<samp><span class="option">--enable-targets=all</span></samp> set.  This builds <span class="sc">gdb</span> with all supported
targets activated.  This helps testing <span class="sc">gdb</span> when doing changes that
affect more than one architecture and is much faster than using
<samp><span class="file">gdb_mbuild.sh</span></samp>.

   <p>After building <span class="sc">gdb</span> the script checks which architectures are
supported and then switches the current architecture to each of those to get
information about the architecture.  The test results are stored in log files
in the directory the script was called from.
