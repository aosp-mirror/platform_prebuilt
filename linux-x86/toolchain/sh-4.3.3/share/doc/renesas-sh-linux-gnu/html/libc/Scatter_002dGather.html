<h3 class="section">13.6 Fast Scatter-Gather I/O</h3>

<p><a name="index-scatter_002dgather-1249"></a>
Some applications may need to read or write data to multiple buffers,
which are separated in memory.  Although this can be done easily enough
with multiple calls to <code>read</code> and <code>write</code>, it is inefficient
because there is overhead associated with each kernel call.

   <p>Instead, many platforms provide special high-speed primitives to perform
these <dfn>scatter-gather</dfn> operations in a single kernel call.  The GNU C
library will provide an emulation on any system that lacks these
primitives, so they are not a portability threat.  They are defined in
<code>sys/uio.h</code>.

   <p>These functions are controlled with arrays of <code>iovec</code> structures,
which describe the location and size of each buffer.

<!-- sys/uio.h -->
<!-- BSD -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Data Type: <b>struct iovec</b><var><a name="index-struct-iovec-1250"></a></var><br>
<blockquote>
        <p>The <code>iovec</code> structure describes a buffer. It contains two fields:

          <dl>
<dt><code>void *iov_base</code><dd>Contains the address of a buffer.

          <br><dt><code>size_t iov_len</code><dd>Contains the length of the buffer.

        </dl>
        </p></blockquote></div>

<!-- sys/uio.h -->
<!-- BSD -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: ssize_t <b>readv</b> (<var>int filedes, const struct iovec *vector, int count</var>)<var><a name="index-readv-1251"></a></var><br>
<blockquote>
        <p>The <code>readv</code> function reads data from <var>filedes</var> and scatters it
into the buffers described in <var>vector</var>, which is taken to be
<var>count</var> structures long.  As each buffer is filled, data is sent to the
next.

        <p>Note that <code>readv</code> is not guaranteed to fill all the buffers. 
It may stop at any point, for the same reasons <code>read</code> would.

        <p>The return value is a count of bytes (<em>not</em> buffers) read, 0
indicating end-of-file, or -1 indicating an error.  The possible
errors are the same as in <code>read</code>.

        </blockquote></div>

<!-- sys/uio.h -->
<!-- BSD -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: ssize_t <b>writev</b> (<var>int filedes, const struct iovec *vector, int count</var>)<var><a name="index-writev-1252"></a></var><br>
<blockquote>
        <p>The <code>writev</code> function gathers data from the buffers described in
<var>vector</var>, which is taken to be <var>count</var> structures long, and writes
them to <code>filedes</code>.  As each buffer is written, it moves on to the
next.

        <p>Like <code>readv</code>, <code>writev</code> may stop midstream under the same
conditions <code>write</code> would.

        <p>The return value is a count of bytes written, or -1 indicating an
error.  The possible errors are the same as in <code>write</code>.

        </blockquote></div>

<!-- Note - I haven't read this anywhere. I surmised it from my knowledge -->
<!-- of computer science. Thus, there could be subtleties I'm missing. -->
   <p>Note that if the buffers are small (under about 1kB), high-level streams
may be easier to use than these functions.  However, <code>readv</code> and
<code>writev</code> are more efficient when the individual buffers themselves
(as opposed to the total output), are large.  In that case, a high-level
stream would not be able to cache the data effectively.
