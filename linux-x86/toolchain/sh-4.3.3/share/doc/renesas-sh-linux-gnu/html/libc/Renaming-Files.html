<h3 class="section">14.7 Renaming Files</h3>

<p>The <code>rename</code> function is used to change a file's name.

   <p><a name="index-renaming-a-file-1482"></a><!-- stdio.h -->
<!-- ISO -->

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: int <b>rename</b> (<var>const char *oldname, const char *newname</var>)<var><a name="index-rename-1483"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The <code>rename</code> function renames the file <var>oldname</var> to
<var>newname</var>.  The file formerly accessible under the name
<var>oldname</var> is afterwards accessible as <var>newname</var> instead.  (If
the file had any other names aside from <var>oldname</var>, it continues to
have those names.)

        <p>The directory containing the name <var>newname</var> must be on the same file
system as the directory containing the name <var>oldname</var>.

        <p>One special case for <code>rename</code> is when <var>oldname</var> and
<var>newname</var> are two names for the same file.  The consistent way to
handle this case is to delete <var>oldname</var>.  However, in this case
POSIX requires that <code>rename</code> do nothing and report success&mdash;which
is inconsistent.  We don't know what your operating system will do.

        <p>If <var>oldname</var> is not a directory, then any existing file named
<var>newname</var> is removed during the renaming operation.  However, if
<var>newname</var> is the name of a directory, <code>rename</code> fails in this
case.

        <p>If <var>oldname</var> is a directory, then either <var>newname</var> must not
exist or it must name a directory that is empty.  In the latter case,
the existing directory named <var>newname</var> is deleted first.  The name
<var>newname</var> must not specify a subdirectory of the directory
<code>oldname</code> which is being renamed.

        <p>One useful feature of <code>rename</code> is that the meaning of <var>newname</var>
changes &ldquo;atomically&rdquo; from any previously existing file by that name to
its new meaning (i.e., the file that was called <var>oldname</var>).  There is
no instant at which <var>newname</var> is non-existent &ldquo;in between&rdquo; the old
meaning and the new meaning.  If there is a system crash during the
operation, it is possible for both names to still exist; but
<var>newname</var> will always be intact if it exists at all.

        <p>If <code>rename</code> fails, it returns <code>-1</code>.  In addition to the usual
file name errors (see <a href="File-Name-Errors.html#File-Name-Errors">File Name Errors</a>), the following
<code>errno</code> error conditions are defined for this function:

          <dl>
<dt><code>EACCES</code><dd>One of the directories containing <var>newname</var> or <var>oldname</var>
refuses write permission; or <var>newname</var> and <var>oldname</var> are
directories and write permission is refused for one of them.

          <br><dt><code>EBUSY</code><dd>A directory named by <var>oldname</var> or <var>newname</var> is being used by
the system in a way that prevents the renaming from working.  This includes
directories that are mount points for filesystems, and directories
that are the current working directories of processes.

          <br><dt><code>ENOTEMPTY</code><dt><code>EEXIST</code><dd>The directory <var>newname</var> isn't empty.  The GNU system always returns
<code>ENOTEMPTY</code> for this, but some other systems return <code>EEXIST</code>.

          <br><dt><code>EINVAL</code><dd><var>oldname</var> is a directory that contains <var>newname</var>.

          <br><dt><code>EISDIR</code><dd><var>newname</var> is a directory but the <var>oldname</var> isn't.

          <br><dt><code>EMLINK</code><dd>The parent directory of <var>newname</var> would have too many links
(entries).

          <br><dt><code>ENOENT</code><dd>The file <var>oldname</var> doesn't exist.

          <br><dt><code>ENOSPC</code><dd>The directory that would contain <var>newname</var> has no room for another
entry, and there is no space left in the file system to expand it.

          <br><dt><code>EROFS</code><dd>The operation would involve writing to a directory on a read-only file
system.

          <br><dt><code>EXDEV</code><dd>The two file names <var>newname</var> and <var>oldname</var> are on different
file systems.
