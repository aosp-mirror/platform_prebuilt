<h5 class="subsubsection">7.6.1.2 Printing the Currency Symbol</h5>

<p><a name="index-currency-symbols-712"></a>
These members of the <code>struct lconv</code> structure specify how to print
the symbol to identify a monetary value&mdash;the international analog of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; for US dollars.

   <p>Each country has two standard currency symbols.  The <dfn>local currency
symbol</dfn> is used commonly within the country, while the
<dfn>international currency symbol</dfn> is used internationally to refer to
that country's currency when it is necessary to indicate the country
unambiguously.

   <p>For example, many countries use the dollar as their monetary unit, and
when dealing with international currencies it's important to specify
that one is dealing with (say) Canadian dollars instead of U.S. dollars
or Australian dollars.  But when the context is known to be Canada,
there is no need to make this explicit&mdash;dollar amounts are implicitly
assumed to be in Canadian dollars.

     <dl>
<dt><code>char *currency_symbol</code><dd>The local currency symbol for the selected locale.

     <p>In the standard &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>&rsquo; locale, this member has a value of <code>""</code>
(the empty string), meaning &ldquo;unspecified&rdquo;.  The ISO standard doesn't
say what to do when you find this value; we recommend you simply print
the empty string as you would print any other string pointed to by this
variable.

     <br><dt><code>char *int_curr_symbol</code><dd>The international currency symbol for the selected locale.

     <p>The value of <code>int_curr_symbol</code> should normally consist of a
three-letter abbreviation determined by the international standard
<cite>ISO 4217 Codes for the Representation of Currency and Funds</cite>,
followed by a one-character separator (often a space).

     <p>In the standard &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>&rsquo; locale, this member has a value of <code>""</code>
(the empty string), meaning &ldquo;unspecified&rdquo;.  We recommend you simply print
the empty string as you would print any other string pointed to by this
variable.

     <br><dt><code>char p_cs_precedes</code><dt><code>char n_cs_precedes</code><dt><code>char int_p_cs_precedes</code><dt><code>char int_n_cs_precedes</code><dd>These members are <code>1</code> if the <code>currency_symbol</code> or
<code>int_curr_symbol</code> strings should precede the value of a monetary
amount, or <code>0</code> if the strings should follow the value.  The
<code>p_cs_precedes</code> and <code>int_p_cs_precedes</code> members apply to
positive amounts (or zero), and the <code>n_cs_precedes</code> and
<code>int_n_cs_precedes</code> members apply to negative amounts.

     <p>In the standard &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>&rsquo; locale, all of these members have a value of
<code>CHAR_MAX</code>, meaning &ldquo;unspecified&rdquo;.  The ISO standard doesn't say
what to do when you find this value.  We recommend printing the
currency symbol before the amount, which is right for most countries. 
In other words, treat all nonzero values alike in these members.

     <p>The members with the <code>int_</code> prefix apply to the
<code>int_curr_symbol</code> while the other two apply to
<code>currency_symbol</code>.

     <br><dt><code>char p_sep_by_space</code><dt><code>char n_sep_by_space</code><dt><code>char int_p_sep_by_space</code><dt><code>char int_n_sep_by_space</code><dd>These members are <code>1</code> if a space should appear between the
<code>currency_symbol</code> or <code>int_curr_symbol</code> strings and the
amount, or <code>0</code> if no space should appear.  The
<code>p_sep_by_space</code> and <code>int_p_sep_by_space</code> members apply to
positive amounts (or zero), and the <code>n_sep_by_space</code> and
<code>int_n_sep_by_space</code> members apply to negative amounts.

     <p>In the standard &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>&rsquo; locale, all of these members have a value of
<code>CHAR_MAX</code>, meaning &ldquo;unspecified&rdquo;.  The ISO standard doesn't say
what you should do when you find this value; we suggest you treat it as
1 (print a space).  In other words, treat all nonzero values alike in
these members.

     <p>The members with the <code>int_</code> prefix apply to the
<code>int_curr_symbol</code> while the other two apply to
<code>currency_symbol</code>.  There is one specialty with the
<code>int_curr_symbol</code>, though.  Since all legal values contain a space
at the end the string one either printf this space (if the currency
symbol must appear in front and must be separated) or one has to avoid
printing this character at all (especially when at the end of the
string).
