<h3 class="section">16.1 Socket Concepts</h3>

<p><a name="index-communication-style-_0028of-a-socket_0029-1631"></a><a name="index-style-of-communication-_0028of-a-socket_0029-1632"></a>When you create a socket, you must specify the style of communication
you want to use and the type of protocol that should implement it. 
The <dfn>communication style</dfn> of a socket defines the user-level
semantics of sending and receiving data on the socket.  Choosing a
communication style specifies the answers to questions such as these:

     <ul>
<li><a name="index-packet-1633"></a><a name="index-byte-stream-1634"></a><a name="index-stream-_0028sockets_0029-1635"></a><strong>What are the units of data transmission?</strong>  Some communication
styles regard the data as a sequence of bytes with no larger
structure; others group the bytes into records (which are known in
this context as <dfn>packets</dfn>).

     <li><a name="index-loss-of-data-on-sockets-1636"></a><a name="index-data-loss-on-sockets-1637"></a><strong>Can data be lost during normal operation?</strong>  Some communication
styles guarantee that all the data sent arrives in the order it was
sent (barring system or network crashes); other styles occasionally
lose data as a normal part of operation, and may sometimes deliver
packets more than once or in the wrong order.

     <p>Designing a program to use unreliable communication styles usually
involves taking precautions to detect lost or misordered packets and
to retransmit data as needed.

     <li><strong>Is communication entirely with one partner?</strong>  Some
communication styles are like a telephone call&mdash;you make a
<dfn>connection</dfn> with one remote socket and then exchange data
freely.  Other styles are like mailing letters&mdash;you specify a
destination address for each message you send. 
</ul>

   <p><a name="index-namespace-_0028of-socket_0029-1638"></a><a name="index-domain-_0028of-socket_0029-1639"></a><a name="index-socket-namespace-1640"></a><a name="index-socket-domain-1641"></a>You must also choose a <dfn>namespace</dfn> for naming the socket.  A socket
name (&ldquo;address&rdquo;) is meaningful only in the context of a particular
namespace.  In fact, even the data type to use for a socket name may
depend on the namespace.  Namespaces are also called &ldquo;domains&rdquo;, but we
avoid that word as it can be confused with other usage of the same
term.  Each namespace has a symbolic name that starts with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">PF_</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
A corresponding symbolic name starting with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">AF_</span></samp>&rsquo; designates the
address format for that namespace.

   <p><a name="index-network-protocol-1642"></a><a name="index-protocol-_0028of-socket_0029-1643"></a><a name="index-socket-protocol-1644"></a><a name="index-protocol-family-1645"></a>Finally you must choose the <dfn>protocol</dfn> to carry out the
communication.  The protocol determines what low-level mechanism is used
to transmit and receive data.  Each protocol is valid for a particular
namespace and communication style; a namespace is sometimes called a
<dfn>protocol family</dfn> because of this, which is why the namespace names
start with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">PF_</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The rules of a protocol apply to the data passing between two programs,
perhaps on different computers; most of these rules are handled by the
operating system and you need not know about them.  What you do need to
know about protocols is this:

     <ul>
<li>In order to have communication between two sockets, they must specify
the <em>same</em> protocol.

     <li>Each protocol is meaningful with particular style/namespace
combinations and cannot be used with inappropriate combinations.  For
example, the TCP protocol fits only the byte stream style of
communication and the Internet namespace.

     <li>For each combination of style and namespace there is a <dfn>default
protocol</dfn>, which you can request by specifying 0 as the protocol
number.  And that's what you should normally do&mdash;use the default. 
</ul>

   <p>Throughout the following description at various places
variables/parameters to denote sizes are required.  And here the trouble
starts.  In the first implementations the type of these variables was
simply <code>int</code>.  On most machines at that time an <code>int</code> was 32
bits wide, which created a <em>de facto</em> standard requiring 32-bit
variables.  This is important since references to variables of this type
are passed to the kernel.

   <p>Then the POSIX people came and unified the interface with the words "all
size values are of type <code>size_t</code>".  On 64-bit machines
<code>size_t</code> is 64 bits wide, so pointers to variables were no longer
possible.

   <p>The Unix98 specification provides a solution by introducing a type
<code>socklen_t</code>.  This type is used in all of the cases that POSIX
changed to use <code>size_t</code>.  The only requirement of this type is that
it be an unsigned type of at least 32 bits.  Therefore, implementations
which require that references to 32-bit variables be passed can be as
happy as implementations which use 64-bit values.
