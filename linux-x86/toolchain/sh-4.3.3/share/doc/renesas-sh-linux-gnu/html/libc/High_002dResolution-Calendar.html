<h4 class="subsection">21.4.2 High-Resolution Calendar</h4>

<p>The <code>time_t</code> data type used to represent simple times has a
resolution of only one second.  Some applications need more precision.

   <p>So, the GNU C library also contains functions which are capable of
representing calendar times to a higher resolution than one second.  The
functions and the associated data types described in this section are
declared in <samp><span class="file">sys/time.h</span></samp>. 
<a name="index-sys_002ftime_002eh-2627"></a>
<!-- sys/time.h -->
<!-- BSD -->

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Data Type: <b>struct timezone</b><var><a name="index-struct-timezone-2628"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The <code>struct timezone</code> structure is used to hold minimal information
about the local time zone.  It has the following members:

          <dl>
<dt><code>int tz_minuteswest</code><dd>This is the number of minutes west of UTC.

          <br><dt><code>int tz_dsttime</code><dd>If nonzero, Daylight Saving Time applies during some part of the year. 
</dl>

        <p>The <code>struct timezone</code> type is obsolete and should never be used. 
Instead, use the facilities described in <a href="Time-Zone-Functions.html#Time-Zone-Functions">Time Zone Functions</a>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<!-- sys/time.h -->
<!-- BSD -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: int <b>gettimeofday</b> (<var>struct timeval *tp, struct timezone *tzp</var>)<var><a name="index-gettimeofday-2629"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The <code>gettimeofday</code> function returns the current calendar time as
the elapsed time since the epoch in the <code>struct timeval</code> structure
indicated by <var>tp</var>.  (see <a href="Elapsed-Time.html#Elapsed-Time">Elapsed Time</a> for a description of
<code>struct timeval</code>).  Information about the time zone is returned in
the structure pointed at <var>tzp</var>.  If the <var>tzp</var> argument is a null
pointer, time zone information is ignored.

        <p>The return value is <code>0</code> on success and <code>-1</code> on failure.  The
following <code>errno</code> error condition is defined for this function:

          <dl>
<dt><code>ENOSYS</code><dd>The operating system does not support getting time zone information, and
<var>tzp</var> is not a null pointer.  The GNU operating system does not
support using <code>struct&nbsp;timezone</code><!-- /@w --> to represent time zone
information; that is an obsolete feature of 4.3 BSD. 
Instead, use the facilities described in <a href="Time-Zone-Functions.html#Time-Zone-Functions">Time Zone Functions</a>. 
</dl>
        </p></blockquote></div>

<!-- sys/time.h -->
<!-- BSD -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: int <b>settimeofday</b> (<var>const struct timeval *tp, const struct timezone *tzp</var>)<var><a name="index-settimeofday-2630"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The <code>settimeofday</code> function sets the current calendar time in the
system clock according to the arguments.  As for <code>gettimeofday</code>,
the calendar time is represented as the elapsed time since the epoch. 
As for <code>gettimeofday</code>, time zone information is ignored if
<var>tzp</var> is a null pointer.

        <p>You must be a privileged user in order to use <code>settimeofday</code>.

        <p>Some kernels automatically set the system clock from some source such as
a hardware clock when they start up.  Others, including Linux, place the
system clock in an &ldquo;invalid&rdquo; state (in which attempts to read the clock
fail).  A call of <code>stime</code> removes the system clock from an invalid
state, and system startup scripts typically run a program that calls
<code>stime</code>.

        <p><code>settimeofday</code> causes a sudden jump forwards or backwards, which
can cause a variety of problems in a system.  Use <code>adjtime</code> (below)
to make a smooth transition from one time to another by temporarily
speeding up or slowing down the clock.

        <p>With a Linux kernel, <code>adjtimex</code> does the same thing and can also
make permanent changes to the speed of the system clock so it doesn't
need to be corrected as often.

        <p>The return value is <code>0</code> on success and <code>-1</code> on failure.  The
following <code>errno</code> error conditions are defined for this function:

          <dl>
<dt><code>EPERM</code><dd>This process cannot set the clock because it is not privileged.

          <br><dt><code>ENOSYS</code><dd>The operating system does not support setting time zone information, and
<var>tzp</var> is not a null pointer. 
</dl>
        </p></blockquote></div>

<!-- On Linux, GNU libc implements adjtime() as a call to adjtimex(). -->
<!-- sys/time.h -->
<!-- BSD -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: int <b>adjtime</b> (<var>const struct timeval *delta, struct timeval *olddelta</var>)<var><a name="index-adjtime-2631"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function speeds up or slows down the system clock in order to make
a gradual adjustment.  This ensures that the calendar time reported by
the system clock is always monotonically increasing, which might not
happen if you simply set the clock.

        <p>The <var>delta</var> argument specifies a relative adjustment to be made to
the clock time.  If negative, the system clock is slowed down for a
while until it has lost this much elapsed time.  If positive, the system
clock is speeded up for a while.

        <p>If the <var>olddelta</var> argument is not a null pointer, the <code>adjtime</code>
function returns information about any previous time adjustment that
has not yet completed.

        <p>This function is typically used to synchronize the clocks of computers
in a local network.  You must be a privileged user to use it.

        <p>With a Linux kernel, you can use the <code>adjtimex</code> function to
permanently change the clock speed.

        <p>The return value is <code>0</code> on success and <code>-1</code> on failure.  The
following <code>errno</code> error condition is defined for this function:

          <dl>
<dt><code>EPERM</code><dd>You do not have privilege to set the time. 
</dl>
        </p></blockquote></div>

   <p><strong>Portability Note:</strong>  The <code>gettimeofday</code>, <code>settimeofday</code>,
and <code>adjtime</code> functions are derived from BSD.

   <p>Symbols for the following function are declared in <samp><span class="file">sys/timex.h</span></samp>.

<blockquote>
        <p><code>adjtimex</code> is functionally identical to <code>ntp_adjtime</code>. 
See <a href="High-Accuracy-Clock.html#High-Accuracy-Clock">High Accuracy Clock</a>.

        <p>This function is present only with a Linux kernel.
