<h3 class="section">29.8 Enabling and Disabling Setuid Access</h3>

<p>A typical setuid program does not need its special access all of the
time.  It's a good idea to turn off this access when it isn't needed,
so it can't possibly give unintended access.

   <p>If the system supports the <code>_POSIX_SAVED_IDS</code> feature, you can
accomplish this with <code>seteuid</code>.  When the game program starts, its
real user ID is <code>jdoe</code>, its effective user ID is <code>games</code>, and
its saved user ID is also <code>games</code>.  The program should record both
user ID values once at the beginning, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     user_user_id = getuid ();
     game_user_id = geteuid ();
</pre>
   <p>Then it can turn off game file access with

<pre class="smallexample">     seteuid (user_user_id);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and turn it on with

<pre class="smallexample">     seteuid (game_user_id);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Throughout this process, the real user ID remains <code>jdoe</code> and the
file user ID remains <code>games</code>, so the program can always set its
effective user ID to either one.

   <p>On other systems that don't support file user IDs, you can
turn setuid access on and off by using <code>setreuid</code> to swap the real
and effective user IDs of the process, as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     setreuid (geteuid (), getuid ());
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This special case is always allowed&mdash;it cannot fail.

   <p>Why does this have the effect of toggling the setuid access?  Suppose a
game program has just started, and its real user ID is <code>jdoe</code> while
its effective user ID is <code>games</code>.  In this state, the game can
write the scores file.  If it swaps the two uids, the real becomes
<code>games</code> and the effective becomes <code>jdoe</code>; now the program has
only <code>jdoe</code> access.  Another swap brings <code>games</code> back to
the effective user ID and restores access to the scores file.

   <p>In order to handle both kinds of systems, test for the saved user ID
feature with a preprocessor conditional, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     #ifdef _POSIX_SAVED_IDS
       seteuid (user_user_id);
     #else
       setreuid (geteuid (), getuid ());
     #endif
</pre>
   </body></html>
