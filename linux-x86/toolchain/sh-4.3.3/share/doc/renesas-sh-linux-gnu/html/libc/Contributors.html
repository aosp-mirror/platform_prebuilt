<!-- %MENU% Who wrote what parts of the GNU C library -->
<h2 class="appendix">Appendix E Contributors to the GNU C Library</h2>

<p>The GNU C library was written originally by Roland McGrath, and is
currently maintained by Ulrich Drepper.  Some parts of the library were
contributed or worked on by other people.

     <ul>
<li>The <code>getopt</code> function and related code was written by
Richard Stallman, David&nbsp;J.<!-- /@w --> MacKenzie, and Roland&nbsp;McGrath<!-- /@w -->.

     <li>The merge sort function <code>qsort</code> was written by Michael J. Haertel.

     <li>The quick sort function used as a fallback by <code>qsort</code> was written
by Douglas C. Schmidt.

     <li>The memory allocation functions <code>malloc</code>, <code>realloc</code> and
<code>free</code> and related code were written by Michael J. Haertel,
Wolfram&nbsp;Gloger<!-- /@w -->, and Doug&nbsp;Lea<!-- /@w -->.

     <li>Fast implementations of many of the string functions (<code>memcpy</code>,
<code>strlen</code>, etc.) were written by Torbj&ouml;rn Granlund.

     <li>The <samp><span class="file">tar.h</span></samp> header file was written by David J. MacKenzie.

     <li>The port to the MIPS DECStation running Ultrix 4
(<code>mips-dec-ultrix4</code>)
was contributed by Brendan Kehoe and Ian Lance Taylor.

     <li>The DES encryption function <code>crypt</code> and related functions were
contributed by Michael Glad.

     <li>The <code>ftw</code> and <code>nftw</code> functions were contributed by Ulrich Drepper.

     <li>The startup code to support SunOS shared libraries was contributed by
Tom Quinn.

     <li>The <code>mktime</code> function was contributed by Paul Eggert.

     <li>The port to the Sequent Symmetry running Dynix version 3
(<code>i386-sequent-bsd</code>) was contributed by Jason Merrill.

     <li>The timezone support code is derived from the public-domain timezone
package by Arthur David Olson and his many contributors.

     <li>The port to the DEC Alpha running OSF/1 (<code>alpha-dec-osf1</code>) was
contributed by Brendan Kehoe, using some code written by Roland McGrath.

     <li>The port to SGI machines running Irix 4 (<code>mips-sgi-irix4</code>) was
contributed by Tom Quinn.

     <li>The port of the Mach and Hurd code to the MIPS architecture
(<code>mips-</code><var>anything</var><code>-gnu</code>) was contributed by Kazumoto Kojima.

     <li>The floating-point printing function used by <code>printf</code> and friends
and the floating-point reading function used by <code>scanf</code>,
<code>strtod</code> and friends were written by Ulrich Drepper.  The
multi-precision integer functions used in those functions are taken from
GNU MP, which was contributed by Torbj&ouml;rn Granlund.

     <li>The internationalization support in the library, and the support
programs <code>locale</code> and <code>localedef</code>, were written by Ulrich
Drepper.  Ulrich Drepper adapted the support code for message catalogs
(<samp><span class="file">libintl.h</span></samp>, etc.) from the GNU <code>gettext</code> package, which he
also wrote.  He also contributed the <code>catgets</code> support and the
entire suite of multi-byte and wide-character support functions
(<samp><span class="file">wctype.h</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">wchar.h</span></samp>, etc.).

     <li>The implementations of the <samp><span class="file">nsswitch.conf</span></samp> mechanism and the files
and DNS backends for it were designed and written by Ulrich Drepper and
Roland McGrath, based on a backend interface defined by Peter Eriksson.

     <li>The port to Linux i386/ELF (<code>i386-</code><var>anything</var><code>-linux</code>) was
contributed by Ulrich Drepper, based in large part on work done in
Hongjiu Lu's Linux version of the GNU C Library.

     <li>The port to Linux/m68k (<code>m68k-</code><var>anything</var><code>-linux</code>) was
contributed by Andreas Schwab.

     <li>The ports to Linux/ARM (<code>arm-</code><var>ANYTHING</var><code>-linuxaout</code>) and ARM
standalone (<code>arm-</code><var>ANYTHING</var><code>-none</code>), as well as parts of the
IPv6 support code, were contributed by Philip Blundell.

     <li>Richard Henderson contributed the ELF dynamic linking code and other
support for the Alpha processor.

     <li>David Mosberger-Tang contributed the port to Linux/Alpha
(<code>alpha-</code><var>anything</var><code>-linux</code>).

     <li>The port to Linux on PowerPC (<code>powerpc-</code><var>anything</var><code>-linux</code>)
was contributed by Geoffrey Keating.

     <li>Miles Bader wrote the argp argument-parsing package, and the argz/envz
interfaces.

     <li>Stephen R. van den Berg contributed a highly-optimized <code>strstr</code> function.

     <li>Ulrich Drepper contributed the <code>hsearch</code> and <code>drand48</code>
families of functions; reentrant &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...</span><code>_r</code></samp>&rsquo; versions of the
<code>random</code> family; System V shared memory and IPC support code; and
several highly-optimized string functions for i<var>x</var>86 processors.

     <li>The math functions are taken from <code>fdlibm-5.1</code> by Sun
Microsystems, as modified by J.T. Conklin, Ian Lance Taylor,
Ulrich Drepper, Andreas Schwab, and Roland McGrath.

     <li>The <code>libio</code> library used to implement <code>stdio</code> functions on
some platforms was written by Per Bothner and modified by Ulrich Drepper.

     <li>Eric Youngdale and Ulrich Drepper implemented versioning of objects on
the symbol level.

     <li>Thorsten Kukuk provided an implementation for NIS (YP) and NIS+,
securelevel 0, 1 and 2.

     <li>Andreas Jaeger provided a test suite for the math library.

     <li>Mark Kettenis implemented the utmpx interface and an utmp daemon.

     <li>Ulrich Drepper added character conversion functions (<code>iconv</code>).

     <li>Thorsten Kukuk provided an implementation for a caching daemon for NSS
(nscd).

     <li>Tim Waugh provided an implementation of the POSIX.2 wordexp function family.

     <li>Mark Kettenis provided a Hesiod NSS module.

     <li>The Internet-related code (most of the <samp><span class="file">inet</span></samp> subdirectory) and
several other miscellaneous functions and header files have been
included from 4.4 BSD with little or no modification.  The copying
permission notice for this code can be found in the file <samp><span class="file">LICENSES</span></samp>
in the source distribution.

     <li>The random number generation functions <code>random</code>, <code>srandom</code>,
<code>setstate</code> and <code>initstate</code>, which are also the basis for the
<code>rand</code> and <code>srand</code> functions, were written by Earl T. Cohen
for the University of California at Berkeley and are copyrighted by the
Regents of the University of California.  They have undergone minor
changes to fit into the GNU C library and to fit the ISO&nbsp;C<!-- /@w --> standard,
but the functional code is Berkeley's.

     <li>The DNS resolver code is taken directly from BIND 4.9.5, which
includes copyrighted code from UC Berkeley and from Digital Equipment
Corporation.  See the file <samp><span class="file">LICENSES</span></samp> for the text of the DEC license.

     <li>The code to support Sun RPC is taken verbatim from Sun's
<span class="sc">rpcsrc-4.0</span><!-- /@w --> distribution; see the file <samp><span class="file">LICENSES</span></samp> for the
text of the license.

     <li>Some of the support code for Mach is taken from Mach 3.0 by CMU;
the file if_ppp.h is also copyright by CMU, but under a different license;
see the file <samp><span class="file">LICENSES</span></samp> for the text of the licenses.

     <li>Many of the IA64 math functions are taken from a collection of
&ldquo;Highly Optimized Mathematical Functions for Itanium&rdquo; that Intel
makes available under a free license; see the file <samp><span class="file">LICENSES</span></samp> for
details.

     <li>The <code>getaddrinfo</code> and <code>getnameinfo</code> functions and supporting
code were written by Craig Metz; see the file <samp><span class="file">LICENSES</span></samp> for
details on their licensing.

     <li>Many of the IEEE 64-bit double precision math functions
(in the <samp><span class="file">sysdeps/ieee754/dbl-64</span></samp> subdirectory) come
from the IBM Accurate Mathematical Library, contributed by IBM.
