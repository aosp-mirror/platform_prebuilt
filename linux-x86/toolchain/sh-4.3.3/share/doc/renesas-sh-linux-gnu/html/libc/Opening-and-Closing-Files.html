<h3 class="section">13.1 Opening and Closing Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-opening-a-file-descriptor-1196"></a><a name="index-closing-a-file-descriptor-1197"></a>This section describes the primitives for opening and closing files
using file descriptors.  The <code>open</code> and <code>creat</code> functions are
declared in the header file <samp><span class="file">fcntl.h</span></samp>, while <code>close</code> is
declared in <samp><span class="file">unistd.h</span></samp>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: int <b>open</b> (<var>const char *filename, int flags</var>[<var>, mode_t mode</var>])<var><a name="index-open-1200"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The <code>open</code> function creates and returns a new file descriptor
for the file named by <var>filename</var>.  Initially, the file position
indicator for the file is at the beginning of the file.  The argument
<var>mode</var> is used only when a file is created, but it doesn't hurt
to supply the argument in any case.

        <p>The <var>flags</var> argument controls how the file is to be opened.  This is
a bit mask; you create the value by the bitwise OR of the appropriate
parameters (using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo; operator in C). 
See <a href="File-Status-Flags.html#File-Status-Flags">File Status Flags</a>, for the parameters available.

        <p>The normal return value from <code>open</code> is a non-negative integer file
descriptor.  In the case of an error, a value of -1 is returned
instead.  In addition to the usual file name errors (see <a href="File-Name-Errors.html#File-Name-Errors">File Name Errors</a>), the following <code>errno</code> error conditions are defined
for this function:

          <dl>
<dt><code>EACCES</code><dd>The file exists but is not readable/writable as requested by the <var>flags</var>
argument, the file does not exist and the directory is unwritable so
it cannot be created.

          <br><dt><code>EEXIST</code><dd>Both <code>O_CREAT</code> and <code>O_EXCL</code> are set, and the named file already
exists.

          <br><dt><code>EINTR</code><dd>The <code>open</code> operation was interrupted by a signal. 
See <a href="Interrupted-Primitives.html#Interrupted-Primitives">Interrupted Primitives</a>.

          <br><dt><code>EISDIR</code><dd>The <var>flags</var> argument specified write access, and the file is a directory.

          <br><dt><code>EMFILE</code><dd>The process has too many files open. 
The maximum number of file descriptors is controlled by the
<code>RLIMIT_NOFILE</code> resource limit; see <a href="Limits-on-Resources.html#Limits-on-Resources">Limits on Resources</a>.

          <br><dt><code>ENFILE</code><dd>The entire system, or perhaps the file system which contains the
directory, cannot support any additional open files at the moment. 
(This problem cannot happen on the GNU system.)

          <br><dt><code>ENOENT</code><dd>The named file does not exist, and <code>O_CREAT</code> is not specified.

          <br><dt><code>ENOSPC</code><dd>The directory or file system that would contain the new file cannot be
extended, because there is no disk space left.

          <br><dt><code>ENXIO</code><dd><code>O_NONBLOCK</code> and <code>O_WRONLY</code> are both set in the <var>flags</var>
argument, the file named by <var>filename</var> is a FIFO (see <a href="Pipes-and-FIFOs.html#Pipes-and-FIFOs">Pipes and FIFOs</a>), and no process has the file open for reading.

          <br><dt><code>EROFS</code><dd>The file resides on a read-only file system and any of <code>O_WRONLY</code><!-- /@w -->,
<code>O_RDWR</code>, and <code>O_TRUNC</code> are set in the <var>flags</var> argument,
or <code>O_CREAT</code> is set and the file does not already exist. 
</dl>

     <!-- !!! umask -->
        <p>If on a 32 bit machine the sources are translated with
<code>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64</code> the function <code>open</code> returns a file
descriptor opened in the large file mode which enables the file handling
functions to use files up to 2^63 bytes in size and offset from
-2^63 to 2^63.  This happens transparently for the user
since all of the lowlevel file handling functions are equally replaced.

        <p>This function is a cancellation point in multi-threaded programs.  This
is a problem if the thread allocates some resources (like memory, file
descriptors, semaphores or whatever) at the time <code>open</code> is
called.  If the thread gets canceled these resources stay allocated
until the program ends.  To avoid this calls to <code>open</code> should be
protected using cancellation handlers. 
<!-- ref pthread_cleanup_push / pthread_cleanup_pop -->

        <p>The <code>open</code> function is the underlying primitive for the <code>fopen</code>
and <code>freopen</code> functions, that create streams.

<blockquote><p>This function is similar to <code>open</code>.  It returns a file descriptor
which can be used to access the file named by <var>filename</var>.  The only
difference is that on 32 bit systems the file is opened in the

replaces the old API.

&mdash; Obsolete function: int <b>creat</b> (<var>const char *filename, mode_t mode</var>)<var><a name="index-creat-1202"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function is obsolete.  The call:

     <pre class="smallexample">          creat (<var>filename</var>, <var>mode</var>)
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">is equivalent to:

     <pre class="smallexample">          open (<var>filename</var>, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, <var>mode</var>)

        <p>If on a 32 bit machine the sources are translated with
<code>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64</code> the function <code>creat</code> returns a file
descriptor opened in the large file mode which enables the file handling
functions to use files up to 2^63 in size and offset from
-2^63 to 2^63.  This happens transparently for the user
since all of the lowlevel file handling functions are equally replaced.

&mdash; Obsolete function: int <b>creat64</b> (<var>const char *filename, mode_t mode</var>)<var><a name="index-creat64-1203"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function is similar to <code>creat</code>.  It returns a file descriptor
which can be used to access the file named by <var>filename</var>.  The only
the difference is that on 32 bit systems the file is opened in the
large file mode.  I.e., file length and file offsets can exceed 31 bits.

        <p>To use this file descriptor one must not use the normal operations but
instead the counterparts named <code>*64</code>, e.g., <code>read64</code>.

        <p>When the sources are translated with <code>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64</code> this
function is actually available under the name <code>open</code>.  I.e., the

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: int <b>close</b> (<var>int filedes</var>)<var><a name="index-close-1204"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The function <code>close</code> closes the file descriptor <var>filedes</var>. 
Closing a file has the following consequences:

          <ul>
<li>The file descriptor is deallocated.

          <li>Any record locks owned by the process on the file are unlocked.

          <li>When all file descriptors associated with a pipe or FIFO have been closed,
any unread data is discarded. 
</ul>

        <p>This function is a cancellation point in multi-threaded programs.  This
is a problem if the thread allocates some resources (like memory, file
descriptors, semaphores or whatever) at the time <code>close</code> is
called.  If the thread gets canceled these resources stay allocated
until the program ends.  To avoid this, calls to <code>close</code> should be
protected using cancellation handlers. 
<!-- ref pthread_cleanup_push / pthread_cleanup_pop -->

        <p>The normal return value from <code>close</code> is 0; a value of -1
is returned in case of failure.  The following <code>errno</code> error
conditions are defined for this function:

          <dl>
<dt><code>EBADF</code><dd>The <var>filedes</var> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

          <br><dt><code>EINTR</code><dd>The <code>close</code> call was interrupted by a signal. 
See <a href="Interrupted-Primitives.html#Interrupted-Primitives">Interrupted Primitives</a>. 
Here is an example of how to handle <code>EINTR</code> properly:

          <pre class="smallexample">               TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY (close (desc));
</pre>
          <br><dt><code>ENOSPC</code><dt><code>EIO</code><dt><code>EDQUOT</code><dd>When the file is accessed by NFS, these errors from <code>write</code> can sometimes
not be detected until <code>close</code>.  See <a href="I_002fO-Primitives.html#I_002fO-Primitives">I/O Primitives</a>, for details
on their meaning. 
</dl>

        <p>Please note that there is <em>no</em> separate <code>close64</code> function. 
This is not necessary since this function does not determine nor depend
on the mode of the file.  The kernel which performs the <code>close</code>
operation knows which mode the descriptor is used for and can handle
this situation. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>To close a stream, call <code>fclose</code> (see <a href="Closing-Streams.html#Closing-Streams">Closing Streams</a>) instead
of trying to close its underlying file descriptor with <code>close</code>. 
This flushes any buffered output and updates the stream object to
indicate that it is closed.
