<h5 class="subsubsection">3.2.4.6 Growing Objects</h5>

<p><a name="index-growing-objects-_0028in-obstacks_0029-313"></a><a name="index-changing-the-size-of-a-block-_0028obstacks_0029-314"></a>
Because memory in obstack chunks is used sequentially, it is possible to
build up an object step by step, adding one or more bytes at a time to the
end of the object.  With this technique, you do not need to know how much
data you will put in the object until you come to the end of it.  We call
this the technique of <dfn>growing objects</dfn>.  The special functions
for adding data to the growing object are described in this section.

   <p>You don't need to do anything special when you start to grow an object. 
Using one of the functions to add data to the object automatically
starts it.  However, it is necessary to say explicitly when the object is
finished.  This is done with the function <code>obstack_finish</code>.

   <p>The actual address of the object thus built up is not known until the
object is finished.  Until then, it always remains possible that you will
add so much data that the object must be copied into a new chunk.

   <p>While the obstack is in use for a growing object, you cannot use it for
ordinary allocation of another object.  If you try to do so, the space
already added to the growing object will become part of the other object.

<code>obstack_blank</code>, which adds space without initializing it.

<blockquote><p>A single value of type <code>int</code> can be added by using the
<code>obstack_int_grow</code> function.  It adds <code>sizeof (int)</code> bytes to
the growing object and initializes them with the value of <var>data</var>.

<blockquote><p>When you are finished growing the object, use the function
<code>obstack_finish</code> to close it off and return its final address.

        <p>Once you have finished the object, the obstack is available for ordinary
allocation or for growing another object.

        <p>This function can return a null pointer under the same conditions as
<code>obstack_alloc</code> (see <a href="Allocation-in-an-Obstack.html#Allocation-in-an-Obstack">Allocation in an Obstack</a>). 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>When you build an object by growing it, you will probably need to know
afterward how long it became.  You need not keep track of this as you grow
the object, because you can find out the length from the obstack just
before finishing the object with the function <code>obstack_object_size</code>,
declared as follows:

<!-- obstack.h -->
<!-- GNU -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: int <b>obstack_object_size</b> (<var>struct obstack *obstack-ptr</var>)<var><a name="index-obstack_005fobject_005fsize-322"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the current size of the growing object, in bytes. 
Remember to call this function <em>before</em> finishing the object. 
After it is finished, <code>obstack_object_size</code> will return zero. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>If you have started growing an object and wish to cancel it, you should
finish it and then free it, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     obstack_free (obstack_ptr, obstack_finish (obstack_ptr));
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This has no effect if no object was growing.

   <p><a name="index-shrinking-objects-323"></a>You can use <code>obstack_blank</code> with a negative size argument to make
the current object smaller.  Just don't try to shrink it beyond zero
length&mdash;there's no telling what will happen if you do that.
