<h3 class="section">12.3 Opening Streams</h3>

<p><a name="index-opening-a-stream-926"></a>Opening a file with the <code>fopen</code> function creates a new stream and
establishes a connection between the stream and a file.  This may
involve creating a new file.

   <p><a name="index-stdio_002eh-927"></a>Everything described in this section is declared in the header file
<samp><span class="file">stdio.h</span></samp>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: FILE * <b>fopen</b> (<var>const char *filename, const char *opentype</var>)<var><a name="index-fopen-928"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The <code>fopen</code> function opens a stream for I/O to the file
<var>filename</var>, and returns a pointer to the stream.

        <p>The <var>opentype</var> argument is a string that controls how the file is
opened and specifies attributes of the resulting stream.  It must begin
with one of the following sequences of characters:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Open an existing file for reading only.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">w</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Open the file for writing only.  If the file already exists, it is
truncated to zero length.  Otherwise a new file is created.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Open a file for append access; that is, writing at the end of file only. 
If the file already exists, its initial contents are unchanged and
output to the stream is appended to the end of the file. 
Otherwise, a new, empty file is created.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r+</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Open an existing file for both reading and writing.  The initial contents
of the file are unchanged and the initial file position is at the
beginning of the file.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">w+</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Open a file for both reading and writing.  If the file already exists, it
is truncated to zero length.  Otherwise, a new file is created.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a+</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Open or create file for both reading and appending.  If the file exists,
its initial contents are unchanged.  Otherwise, a new file is created. 
The initial file position for reading is at the beginning of the file,
but output is always appended to the end of the file. 
</dl>

        <p>As you can see, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; requests a stream that can do both input and
output.  The ISO standard says that when using such a stream, you must
call <code>fflush</code> (see <a href="Stream-Buffering.html#Stream-Buffering">Stream Buffering</a>) or a file positioning
function such as <code>fseek</code> (see <a href="File-Positioning.html#File-Positioning">File Positioning</a>) when switching
from reading to writing or vice versa.  Otherwise, internal buffers
might not be emptied properly.  The GNU C library does not have this
limitation; you can do arbitrary reading and writing operations on a
stream in whatever order.

        <p>Additional characters may appear after these to specify flags for the
call.  Always put the mode (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">w+</span></samp>&rsquo;, etc.) first; that is
the only part you are guaranteed will be understood by all systems.

        <p>The GNU C library defines one additional character for use in
<var>opentype</var>: the character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; insists on creating a new
file&mdash;if a file <var>filename</var> already exists, <code>fopen</code> fails
rather than opening it.  If you use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; you are guaranteed that
you will not clobber an existing file.  This is equivalent to the
<code>O_EXCL</code> option to the <code>open</code> function (see <a href="Opening-and-Closing-Files.html#Opening-and-Closing-Files">Opening and Closing Files</a>).

        <p>The character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; in <var>opentype</var> has a standard meaning; it
requests a binary stream rather than a text stream.  But this makes no
difference in POSIX systems (including the GNU system).  If both
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; are specified, they can appear in either order. 
See <a href="Binary-Streams.html#Binary-Streams">Binary Streams</a>.

        <p><a name="index-stream-orientation-929"></a><a name="index-orientation_002c-stream-930"></a>If the <var>opentype</var> string contains the sequence
<code>,ccs=</code><var>STRING</var> then <var>STRING</var> is taken as the name of a
coded character set and <code>fopen</code> will mark the stream as
wide-oriented which appropriate conversion functions in place to convert
from and to the character set <var>STRING</var> is place.  Any other stream
is opened initially unoriented and the orientation is decided with the
first file operation.  If the first operation is a wide character
operation, the stream is not only marked as wide-oriented, also the
conversion functions to convert to the coded character set used for the
current locale are loaded.  This will not change anymore from this point
on even if the locale selected for the <code>LC_CTYPE</code> category is
changed.

        <p>Any other characters in <var>opentype</var> are simply ignored.  They may be
meaningful in other systems.

        <p>If the open fails, <code>fopen</code> returns a null pointer.

        <p>When the sources are compiling with <code>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64</code> on a
32 bit machine this function is in fact <code>fopen64</code> since the LFS
interface replaces transparently the old interface. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>You can have multiple streams (or file descriptors) pointing to the same
file open at the same time.  If you do only input, this works
straightforwardly, but you must be careful if any output streams are
included.  See <a href="Stream_002fDescriptor-Precautions.html#Stream_002fDescriptor-Precautions">Stream/Descriptor Precautions</a>.  This is equally true
whether the streams are in one program (not usual) or in several
programs (which can easily happen).  It may be advantageous to use the
file locking facilities to avoid simultaneous access.  See <a href="File-Locks.html#File-Locks">File Locks</a>.

&mdash; Function: FILE * <b>fopen64</b> (<var>const char *filename, const char *opentype</var>)<var><a name="index-fopen64-931"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function is similar to <code>fopen</code> but the stream it returns a
pointer for is opened using <code>open64</code>.  Therefore this stream can be
used even on files larger then 2^31 bytes on 32 bit machines.

        <p>Please note that the return type is still <code>FILE *</code>.  There is no
special <code>FILE</code> type for the LFS interface.

        <p>If the sources are compiled with <code>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64</code> on a 32
bits machine this function is available under the name <code>fopen</code>
and so transparently replaces the old interface.

&mdash; Macro: int <b>FOPEN_MAX</b><var><a name="index-FOPEN_005fMAX-932"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this macro is an integer constant expression that
represents the minimum number of streams that the implementation
guarantees can be open simultaneously.  You might be able to open more
than this many streams, but that is not guaranteed.  The value of this
constant is at least eight, which includes the three standard streams
<code>stdin</code>, <code>stdout</code>, and <code>stderr</code>.  In POSIX.1 systems this
value is determined by the <code>OPEN_MAX</code> parameter; see <a href="General-Limits.html#General-Limits">General Limits</a>.  In BSD and GNU, it is controlled by the <code>RLIMIT_NOFILE</code>
resource limit; see <a href="Limits-on-Resources.html#Limits-on-Resources">Limits on Resources</a>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: FILE * <b>freopen</b> (<var>const char *filename, const char *opentype, FILE *stream</var>)<var><a name="index-freopen-933"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function is like a combination of <code>fclose</code> and <code>fopen</code>. 
It first closes the stream referred to by <var>stream</var>, ignoring any
errors that are detected in the process.  (Because errors are ignored,
you should not use <code>freopen</code> on an output stream if you have
actually done any output using the stream.)  Then the file named by
<var>filename</var> is opened with mode <var>opentype</var> as for <code>fopen</code>,
and associated with the same stream object <var>stream</var>.

        <p>If the operation fails, a null pointer is returned; otherwise,
<code>freopen</code> returns <var>stream</var>.

        <p><code>freopen</code> has traditionally been used to connect a standard stream
such as <code>stdin</code> with a file of your own choice.  This is useful in
programs in which use of a standard stream for certain purposes is
hard-coded.  In the GNU C library, you can simply close the standard
streams and open new ones with <code>fopen</code>.  But other systems lack
this ability, so using <code>freopen</code> is more portable.

        <p>When the sources are compiling with <code>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64</code> on a
32 bit machine this function is in fact <code>freopen64</code> since the LFS
interface replaces transparently the old interface.

&mdash; Function: FILE * <b>freopen64</b> (<var>const char *filename, const char *opentype, FILE *stream</var>)<var><a name="index-freopen64-934"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function is similar to <code>freopen</code>.  The only difference is that
on 32 bit machine the stream returned is able to read beyond the
2^31 bytes limits imposed by the normal interface.  It should be
noted that the stream pointed to by <var>stream</var> need not be opened
using <code>fopen64</code> or <code>freopen64</code> since its mode is not important
for this function.

        <p>If the sources are compiled with <code>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64</code> on a 32
bits machine this function is available under the name <code>freopen</code>
and so transparently replaces the old interface. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>In some situations it is useful to know whether a given stream is
available for reading or writing.  This information is normally not
available and would have to be remembered separately.  Solaris
introduced a few functions to get this information from the stream
descriptor and these functions are also available in the GNU C library.

<blockquote><p>The <code>__freadable</code> function determines whether the stream
<var>stream</var> was opened to allow reading.  In this case the return value
is nonzero.  For write-only streams the function returns zero.

<blockquote><p>The <code>__fwritable</code> function determines whether the stream

        <p>This function is declared in <samp><span class="file">stdio_ext.h</span></samp>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>For slightly different kind of problems there are two more functions. 
They provide even finer-grained information.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: int <b>__freading</b> (<var>FILE *stream</var>)<var><a name="index-g_t_005f_005ffreading-937"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The <code>__freading</code> function determines whether the stream
<var>stream</var> was last read from or whether it is opened read-only.  In
this case the return value is nonzero, otherwise it is zero. 
Determining whether a stream opened for reading and writing was last
used for writing allows to draw conclusions about the content about the
buffer, among other things.
