<h5 class="subsubsection">3.2.2.9 Heap Consistency Checking</h5>

<p><a name="index-heap-consistency-checking-278"></a><a name="index-consistency-checking_002c-of-heap-279"></a>
You can ask <code>malloc</code> to check the consistency of dynamic memory by
using the <code>mcheck</code> function.  This function is a GNU extension,
declared in <samp><span class="file">mcheck.h</span></samp>. 
<a name="index-mcheck_002eh-280"></a>
<!-- mcheck.h -->
<!-- GNU -->

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: int <b>mcheck</b> (<var>void </var>(<var>*abortfn</var>) (<var>enum mcheck_status status</var>))<var><a name="index-mcheck-281"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Calling <code>mcheck</code> tells <code>malloc</code> to perform occasional
consistency checks.  These will catch things such as writing
past the end of a block that was allocated with <code>malloc</code>.

        <p>The <var>abortfn</var> argument is the function to call when an inconsistency
is found.  If you supply a null pointer, then <code>mcheck</code> uses a
default function which prints a message and calls <code>abort</code>
(see <a href="Aborting-a-Program.html#Aborting-a-Program">Aborting a Program</a>).  The function you supply is called with
one argument, which says what sort of inconsistency was detected; its
type is described below.

        <p>It is too late to begin allocation checking once you have allocated
anything with <code>malloc</code>.  So <code>mcheck</code> does nothing in that
case.  The function returns <code>-1</code> if you call it too late, and
<code>0</code> otherwise (when it is successful).

        <p>The easiest way to arrange to call <code>mcheck</code> early enough is to use
the option &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-lmcheck</span></samp>&rsquo; when you link your program; then you don't
need to modify your program source at all.  Alternatively you might use
a debugger to insert a call to <code>mcheck</code> whenever the program is
started, for example these gdb commands will automatically call <code>mcheck</code>
whenever the program starts:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) break main
          Breakpoint 1, main (argc=2, argv=0xbffff964) at whatever.c:10
          (gdb) command 1
          Type commands for when breakpoint 1 is hit, one per line.
          End with a line saying just "end".
          &gt;call mcheck(0)
          &gt;continue
          &gt;end
          (gdb) ...
</pre>
        <p>This will however only work if no initialization function of any object
involved calls any of the <code>malloc</code> functions since <code>mcheck</code>
must be called before the first such function.

        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: enum mcheck_status <b>mprobe</b> (<var>void *pointer</var>)<var><a name="index-mprobe-282"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The <code>mprobe</code> function lets you explicitly check for inconsistencies
in a particular allocated block.  You must have already called
<code>mcheck</code> at the beginning of the program, to do its occasional
checks; calling <code>mprobe</code> requests an additional consistency check
to be done at the time of the call.

        <p>The argument <var>pointer</var> must be a pointer returned by <code>malloc</code>
or <code>realloc</code>.  <code>mprobe</code> returns a value that says what
inconsistency, if any, was found.  The values are described below. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Data Type: <b>enum mcheck_status</b><var><a name="index-enum-mcheck_005fstatus-283"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This enumerated type describes what kind of inconsistency was detected
in an allocated block, if any.  Here are the possible values:

          <dl>
<dt><code>MCHECK_DISABLED</code><dd><code>mcheck</code> was not called before the first allocation. 
No consistency checking can be done. 
<br><dt><code>MCHECK_OK</code><dd>No inconsistency detected. 
<br><dt><code>MCHECK_HEAD</code><dd>The data immediately before the block was modified. 
This commonly happens when an array index or pointer
is decremented too far. 
<br><dt><code>MCHECK_TAIL</code><dd>The data immediately after the block was modified. 
This commonly happens when an array index or pointer
is incremented too far. 
<br><dt><code>MCHECK_FREE</code><dd>The block was already freed. 
</dl>
        </p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Another possibility to check for and guard against bugs in the use of
<code>malloc</code>, <code>realloc</code> and <code>free</code> is to set the environment
variable <code>MALLOC_CHECK_</code>.  When <code>MALLOC_CHECK_</code> is set, a
special (less efficient) implementation is used which is designed to be
tolerant against simple errors, such as double calls of <code>free</code> with
the same argument, or overruns of a single byte (off-by-one bugs).  Not
all such errors can be protected against, however, and memory leaks can
result.  If <code>MALLOC_CHECK_</code> is set to <code>0</code>, any detected heap
corruption is silently ignored; if set to <code>1</code>, a diagnostic is
printed on <code>stderr</code>; if set to <code>2</code>, <code>abort</code> is called
immediately.  This can be useful because otherwise a crash may happen
much later, and the true cause for the problem is then very hard to
track down.

   <p>There is one problem with <code>MALLOC_CHECK_</code>: in SUID or SGID binaries
it could possibly be exploited since diverging from the normal programs
behavior it now writes something to the standard error descriptor. 
Therefore the use of <code>MALLOC_CHECK_</code> is disabled by default for
SUID and SGID binaries.  It can be enabled again by the system
administrator by adding a file <samp><span class="file">/etc/suid-debug</span></samp> (the content is
not important it could be empty).

   <p>So, what's the difference between using <code>MALLOC_CHECK_</code> and linking
with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-lmcheck</span></samp>&rsquo;?  <code>MALLOC_CHECK_</code> is orthogonal with respect to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-lmcheck</span></samp>&rsquo;.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-lmcheck</span></samp>&rsquo; has been added for backward
compatibility.  Both <code>MALLOC_CHECK_</code> and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-lmcheck</span></samp>&rsquo; should
uncover the same bugs - but using <code>MALLOC_CHECK_</code> you don't need to
recompile your application.
