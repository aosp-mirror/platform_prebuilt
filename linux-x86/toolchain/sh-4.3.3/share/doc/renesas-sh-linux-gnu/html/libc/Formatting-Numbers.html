<h3 class="section">7.7 A dedicated function to format numbers</h3>

<p>We have seen that the structure returned by <code>localeconv</code> as well as
the values given to <code>nl_langinfo</code> allow you to retrieve the various
pieces of locale-specific information to format numbers and monetary
amounts.  We have also seen that the underlying rules are quite complex.

   <p>Therefore the X/Open standards introduce a function which uses such
locale information, making it easier for the user to format
numbers according to these rules.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: ssize_t <b>strfmon</b> (<var>char *s, size_t maxsize, const char *format, <small class="dots">...</small></var>)<var><a name="index-strfmon-797"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The <code>strfmon</code> function is similar to the <code>strftime</code> function
in that it takes a buffer, its size, a format string,
and values to write into the buffer as text in a form specified
by the format string.  Like <code>strftime</code>, the function
also returns the number of bytes written into the buffer.

        <p>There are two differences: <code>strfmon</code> can take more than one
argument, and, of course, the format specification is different.  Like
<code>strftime</code>, the format string consists of normal text, which is
output as is, and format specifiers, which are indicated by a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Immediately after the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo;, you can optionally specify various flags
and formatting information before the main formatting character, in a
similar way to <code>printf</code>:

          <ul>
<li>Immediately following the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; there can be one or more of the
following flags:
               <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span><var>f</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The single byte character <var>f</var> is used for this field as the numeric
fill character.  By default this character is a space character. 
Filling with this character is only performed if a left precision
is specified.  It is not just to fill to the given field width. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The number is printed without grouping the digits according to the rules
of the current locale.  By default grouping is enabled. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>At most one of these flags can be used.  They select which format to
represent the sign of a currency amount.  By default, and if
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; is given, the locale equivalent of +/- is used.  If
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>&rsquo; is given, negative amounts are enclosed in parentheses.  The
exact format is determined by the values of the <code>LC_MONETARY</code>
category of the locale selected at program runtime. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The output will not contain the currency symbol. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The output will be formatted left-justified instead of right-justified if
it does not fill the entire field width. 
</dl>
          </ul>

        <p>The next part of a specification is an optional field width.  If no
width is specified 0 is taken.  During output, the function first
determines how much space is required.  If it requires at least as many
characters as given by the field width, it is output using as much space
as necessary.  Otherwise, it is extended to use the full width by
filling with the space character.  The presence or absence of the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; flag determines the side at which such padding occurs.  If
present, the spaces are added at the right making the output
left-justified, and vice versa.

        <p>So far the format looks familiar, being similar to the <code>printf</code> and
<code>strftime</code> formats.  However, the next two optional fields
introduce something new.  The first one is a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; character followed
by a decimal digit string.  The value of the digit string specifies the
number of <em>digit</em> positions to the left of the decimal point (or
equivalent).  This does <em>not</em> include the grouping character when
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; flag is not given.  If the space needed to print the number
does not fill the whole width, the field is padded at the left side with
the fill character, which can be selected using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo; flag and by
default is a space.  For example, if the field width is selected as 6
and the number is 123, the fill character is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; the result
will be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">***123</span></samp>&rsquo;.

        <p>The second optional field starts with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; (period) and consists
of another decimal digit string.  Its value describes the number of
characters printed after the decimal point.  The default is selected
from the current locale (<code>frac_digits</code>, <code>int_frac_digits</code>, see
see <a href="General-Numeric.html#General-Numeric">General Numeric</a>).  If the exact representation needs more digits
than given by the field width, the displayed value is rounded.  If the
number of fractional digits is selected to be zero, no decimal point is
printed.

        <p>As a GNU extension, the <code>strfmon</code> implementation in the GNU libc
allows an optional &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>&rsquo; next as a format modifier.  If this modifier
is given, the argument is expected to be a <code>long double</code> instead of
a <code>double</code> value.

        <p>Finally, the last component is a format specifier.  There are three
specifiers defined:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Use the locale's rules for formatting an international currency value. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Use the locale's rules for formatting a national currency value. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Place a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; in the output.  There must be no flag, width
specifier or modifier given, only &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%%</span></samp>&rsquo; is allowed. 
</dl>

        <p>As for <code>printf</code>, the function reads the format string
from left to right and uses the values passed to the function following
the format string.  The values are expected to be either of type
<code>double</code> or <code>long double</code>, depending on the presence of the
modifier &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The result is stored in the buffer pointed to by
<var>s</var>.  At most <var>maxsize</var> characters are stored.

        <p>The return value of the function is the number of characters stored in
<var>s</var>, including the terminating <code>NULL</code> byte.  If the number of
characters stored would exceed <var>maxsize</var>, the function returns
-1 and the content of the buffer <var>s</var> is unspecified.  In this
case <code>errno</code> is set to <code>E2BIG</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>A few examples should make clear how the function works.  It is
assumed that all the following pieces of code are executed in a program
which uses the USA locale (<code>en_US</code>).  The simplest
form of the format is this:

<pre class="smallexample">     strfmon (buf, 100, "@%n@%n@%n@", 123.45, -567.89, 12345.678);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The output produced is
<pre class="smallexample">     "@$123.45@-$567.89@$12,345.68@"
</pre>
   <p>We can notice several things here.  First, the widths of the output
numbers are different.  We have not specified a width in the format
string, and so this is no wonder.  Second, the third number is printed
using thousands separators.  The thousands separator for the
<code>en_US</code> locale is a comma.  The number is also rounded. 
.678 is rounded to .68 since the format does not specify a
precision and the default value in the locale is 2.  Finally,
note that the national currency symbol is printed since &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%n</span></samp>&rsquo; was
used, not &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The next example shows how we can align the output.

<pre class="smallexample">     strfmon (buf, 100, "@%=*11n@%=*11n@%=*11n@", 123.45, -567.89, 12345.678);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The output this time is:

<pre class="smallexample">     "@    $123.45@   -$567.89@ $12,345.68@"
</pre>
   <p>Two things stand out.  Firstly, all fields have the same width (eleven
characters) since this is the width given in the format and since no
number required more characters to be printed.  The second important
point is that the fill character is not used.  This is correct since the
white space was not used to achieve a precision given by a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo;
modifier, but instead to fill to the given width.  The difference
becomes obvious if we now add a width specification.

<pre class="smallexample">     strfmon (buf, 100, "@%=*11#5n@%=*11#5n@%=*11#5n@",
              123.45, -567.89, 12345.678);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The output is

<pre class="smallexample">     "@ $***123.45@-$***567.89@ $12,456.68@"
</pre>
   <p>Here we can see that all the currency symbols are now aligned, and that
the space between the currency sign and the number is filled with the
selected fill character.  Note that although the width is selected to be
5 and 123.45 has three digits left of the decimal point,
the space is filled with three asterisks.  This is correct since, as
explained above, the width does not include the positions used to store
thousands separators.  One last example should explain the remaining
functionality.

<pre class="smallexample">     strfmon (buf, 100, "@%=0(16#5.3i@%=0(16#5.3i@%=0(16#5.3i@",
              123.45, -567.89, 12345.678);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This rather complex format string produces the following output:

<pre class="smallexample">     "@ USD 000123,450 @(USD 000567.890)@ USD 12,345.678 @"
</pre>
   <p>The most noticeable change is the alternative way of representing
negative numbers.  In financial circles this is often done using
parentheses, and this is what the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>&rsquo; flag selected.  The fill
character is now &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Note that this &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>&rsquo; character is not
regarded as a numeric zero, and therefore the first and second numbers
are not printed using a thousands separator.  Since we used the format
specifier &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;, the international form of the
currency symbol is used.  This is a four letter string, in this case
<code>"USD "</code>.  The last point is that since the precision right of the
decimal point is selected to be three, the first and second numbers are
printed with an extra zero at the end and the third number is printed
without rounding.
