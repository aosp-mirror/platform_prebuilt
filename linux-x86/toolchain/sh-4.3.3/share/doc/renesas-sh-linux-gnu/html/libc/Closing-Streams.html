<h3 class="section">12.4 Closing Streams</h3>

<p><a name="index-closing-a-stream-939"></a>When a stream is closed with <code>fclose</code>, the connection between the
stream and the file is canceled.  After you have closed a stream, you
cannot perform any additional operations on it.

<!-- stdio.h -->
<!-- ISO -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: int <b>fclose</b> (<var>FILE *stream</var>)<var><a name="index-fclose-940"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function causes <var>stream</var> to be closed and the connection to
the corresponding file to be broken.  Any buffered output is written
and any buffered input is discarded.  The <code>fclose</code> function returns
a value of <code>0</code> if the file was closed successfully, and <code>EOF</code>
if an error was detected.

        <p>It is important to check for errors when you call <code>fclose</code> to close
an output stream, because real, everyday errors can be detected at this
time.  For example, when <code>fclose</code> writes the remaining buffered
output, it might get an error because the disk is full.  Even if you
know the buffer is empty, errors can still occur when closing a file if
you are using NFS.

        <p>The function <code>fclose</code> is declared in <samp><span class="file">stdio.h</span></samp>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>To close all streams currently available the GNU C Library provides
another function.

<!-- stdio.h -->
<!-- GNU -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: int <b>fcloseall</b> (<var>void</var>)<var><a name="index-fcloseall-941"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function causes all open streams of the process to be closed and
the connection to corresponding files to be broken.  All buffered data
is written and any buffered input is discarded.  The <code>fcloseall</code>
function returns a value of <code>0</code> if all the files were closed
successfully, and <code>EOF</code> if an error was detected.

        <p>This function should be used only in special situations, e.g., when an
error occurred and the program must be aborted.  Normally each single
stream should be closed separately so that problems with individual
streams can be identified.  It is also problematic since the standard
streams (see <a href="Standard-Streams.html#Standard-Streams">Standard Streams</a>) will also be closed.

        <p>The function <code>fcloseall</code> is declared in <samp><span class="file">stdio.h</span></samp>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>If the <code>main</code> function to your program returns, or if you call the
<code>exit</code> function (see <a href="Normal-Termination.html#Normal-Termination">Normal Termination</a>), all open streams are
automatically closed properly.  If your program terminates in any other
manner, such as by calling the <code>abort</code> function (see <a href="Aborting-a-Program.html#Aborting-a-Program">Aborting a Program</a>) or from a fatal signal (see <a href="Signal-Handling.html#Signal-Handling">Signal Handling</a>), open streams
might not be closed properly.  Buffered output might not be flushed and
files may be incomplete.  For more information on buffering of streams,
see <a href="Stream-Buffering.html#Stream-Buffering">Stream Buffering</a>.
