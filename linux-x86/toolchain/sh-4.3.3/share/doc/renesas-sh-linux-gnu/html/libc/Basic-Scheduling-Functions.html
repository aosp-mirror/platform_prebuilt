<h4 class="subsection">22.3.3 Basic Scheduling Functions</h4>

<p>This section describes functions in the GNU C library for setting the
absolute priority and scheduling policy of a process.

   <p><strong>Portability Note:</strong>  On systems that have the functions in this
section, the macro _POSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING is defined in
<samp><span class="file">&lt;unistd.h&gt;</span></samp>.

   <p>For the case that the scheduling policy is traditional scheduling, more
functions to fine tune the scheduling are in <a href="Traditional-Scheduling.html#Traditional-Scheduling">Traditional Scheduling</a>.

   <p>Don't try to make too much out of the naming and structure of these
functions.  They don't match the concepts described in this manual
because the functions are as defined by POSIX.1b, but the implementation
on systems that use the GNU C library is the inverse of what the POSIX
structure contemplates.  The POSIX scheme assumes that the primary
scheduling parameter is the scheduling policy and that the priority
value, if any, is a parameter of the scheduling policy.  In the
implementation, though, the priority value is king and the scheduling
policy, if anything, only fine tunes the effect of that priority.

   <p>The symbols in this section are declared by including file <samp><span class="file">sched.h</span></samp>.

<blockquote>
        <p>This function sets both the absolute priority and the scheduling policy
for a process.

        <p>It assigns the absolute priority value given by <var>param</var> and the
scheduling policy <var>policy</var> to the process with Process ID <var>pid</var>,
or the calling process if <var>pid</var> is zero.  If <var>policy</var> is
negative, <code>sched_setscheduler</code> keeps the existing scheduling policy.

        <p>The following macros represent the valid values for <var>policy</var>:

          <dl>
<dt><code>SCHED_OTHER</code><dd>Traditional Scheduling
<br><dt><code>SCHED_FIFO</code><dd>First In First Out
<br><dt><code>SCHED_RR</code><dd>Round Robin

     <!-- The Linux kernel code (in sched.c) actually reschedules the process, -->
     <!-- but it puts it at the head of the run queue, so I'm not sure just what -->
     <!-- the effect is, but it must be subtle. -->
        <p>On success, the return value is <code>0</code>.  Otherwise, it is <code>-1</code>
and <code>ERRNO</code> is set accordingly.  The <code>errno</code> values specific
to this function are:

          <dl>
<dt><code>EPERM</code><dd>
               <ul>
<li>The calling process does not have <code>CAP_SYS_NICE</code> permission and
<var>policy</var> is not <code>SCHED_OTHER</code> (or it's negative and the
existing policy is not <code>SCHED_OTHER</code>.

               <li>The calling process does not have <code>CAP_SYS_NICE</code> permission and its
owner is not the target process' owner.  I.e., the effective uid of the
calling process is neither the effective nor the real uid of process
<var>pid</var>. 
<!-- We need a cross reference to the capabilities section, when written. -->
</ul>

          <br><dt><code>ESRCH</code><dd>There is no process with pid <var>pid</var> and <var>pid</var> is not zero.

          <br><dt><code>EINVAL</code><dd>
               <ul>
<li><var>policy</var> does not identify an existing scheduling policy.

               <li>The absolute priority value identified by *<var>param</var> is outside the
valid range for the scheduling policy <var>policy</var> (or the existing
scheduling policy if <var>policy</var> is negative) or <var>param</var> is
null.  <code>sched_get_priority_max</code> and <code>sched_get_priority_min</code>
tell you what the valid range is.

               <li><var>pid</var> is negative.

Process ID (pid) <var>pid</var>, or the calling process if <var>pid</var> is zero.

        <p>The return value is the scheduling policy.  See
<code>sched_setscheduler</code> for the possible values.

        <p>If the function fails, the return value is instead <code>-1</code> and

<blockquote>
        <p>This function voluntarily gives up the process' claim on the CPU.

        <p>Technically, <code>sched_yield</code> causes the calling process to be made
immediately ready to run (as opposed to running, which is what it was
before).  This means that if it has absolute priority higher than 0, it
gets pushed onto the tail of the queue of processes that share its
absolute priority and are ready to run, and it will run again when its
turn next arrives.  If its absolute priority is 0, it is more
complicated, but still has the effect of yielding the CPU to other
processes.

        <p>If there are no other processes that share the calling process' absolute
priority, this function doesn't have any effect.

        <p>To the extent that the containing program is oblivious to what other
processes in the system are doing and how fast it executes, this
function appears as a no-op.

        <p>The return value is <code>0</code> on success and in the pathological case
that it fails, the return value is <code>-1</code> and <code>errno</code> is set
accordingly.  There is nothing specific that can go wrong with this
function, so there are no specific <code>errno</code> values.
