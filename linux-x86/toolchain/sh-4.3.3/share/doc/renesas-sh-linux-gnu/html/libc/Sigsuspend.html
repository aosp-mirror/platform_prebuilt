<h4 class="subsection">24.8.3 Using <code>sigsuspend</code></h4>

<p>The clean and reliable way to wait for a signal to arrive is to block it
and then use <code>sigsuspend</code>.  By using <code>sigsuspend</code> in a loop,
you can wait for certain kinds of signals, while letting other kinds of
signals be handled by their handlers.

<!-- signal.h -->
<!-- POSIX.1 -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: int <b>sigsuspend</b> (<var>const sigset_t *set</var>)<var><a name="index-sigsuspend-2981"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function replaces the process's signal mask with <var>set</var> and then
suspends the process until a signal is delivered whose action is either
to terminate the process or invoke a signal handling function.  In other
words, the program is effectively suspended until one of the signals that
is not a member of <var>set</var> arrives.

        <p>If the process is woken up by delivery of a signal that invokes a handler
function, and the handler function returns, then <code>sigsuspend</code> also
returns.

        <p>The mask remains <var>set</var> only as long as <code>sigsuspend</code> is waiting. 
The function <code>sigsuspend</code> always restores the previous signal mask
when it returns.

        <p>The return value and error conditions are the same as for <code>pause</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>With <code>sigsuspend</code>, you can replace the <code>pause</code> or <code>sleep</code>
loop in the previous section with something completely reliable:

<pre class="smallexample">     sigset_t mask, oldmask;
     
     ...
     
     /* <span class="roman">Set up the mask of signals to temporarily block.</span> */
     sigemptyset (&amp;mask);
     sigaddset (&amp;mask, SIGUSR1);
     
     ...
     
     /* <span class="roman">Wait for a signal to arrive.</span> */
     sigprocmask (SIG_BLOCK, &amp;mask, &amp;oldmask);
     while (!usr_interrupt)
       sigsuspend (&amp;oldmask);
     sigprocmask (SIG_UNBLOCK, &amp;mask, NULL);
</pre>
   <p>This last piece of code is a little tricky.  The key point to remember
here is that when <code>sigsuspend</code> returns, it resets the process's
signal mask to the original value, the value from before the call to
<code>sigsuspend</code>&mdash;in this case, the <code>SIGUSR1</code> signal is once
again blocked.  The second call to <code>sigprocmask</code> is
necessary to explicitly unblock this signal.

   <p>One other point: you may be wondering why the <code>while</code> loop is
necessary at all, since the program is apparently only waiting for one
<code>SIGUSR1</code> signal.  The answer is that the mask passed to
<code>sigsuspend</code> permits the process to be woken up by the delivery of
other kinds of signals, as well&mdash;for example, job control signals.  If
the process is woken up by a signal that doesn't set
<code>usr_interrupt</code>, it just suspends itself again until the &ldquo;right&rdquo;
kind of signal eventually arrives.

   <p>This technique takes a few more lines of preparation, but that is needed
just once for each kind of wait criterion you want to use.  The code
that actually waits is just four lines.
