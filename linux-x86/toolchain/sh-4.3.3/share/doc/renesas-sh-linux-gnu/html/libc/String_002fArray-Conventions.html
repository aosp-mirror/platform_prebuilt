<h3 class="section">5.2 String and Array Conventions</h3>

<p>This chapter describes both functions that work on arbitrary arrays or
blocks of memory, and functions that are specific to null-terminated
arrays of characters and wide characters.

   <p>Functions that operate on arbitrary blocks of memory have names
beginning with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mem</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">wmem</span></samp>&rsquo; (such as <code>memcpy</code> and
<code>wmemcpy</code>) and invariably take an argument which specifies the size
(in bytes and wide characters respectively) of the block of memory to
operate on.  The array arguments and return values for these functions
have type <code>void *</code> or <code>wchar_t</code>.  As a matter of style, the
elements of the arrays used with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mem</span></samp>&rsquo; functions are referred
to as &ldquo;bytes&rdquo;.  You can pass any kind of pointer to these functions,
and the <code>sizeof</code> operator is useful in computing the value for the
size argument.  Parameters to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">wmem</span></samp>&rsquo; functions must be of type
<code>wchar_t *</code>.  These functions are not really usable with anything
but arrays of this type.

   <p>In contrast, functions that operate specifically on strings and wide
character strings have names beginning with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">str</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">wcs</span></samp>&rsquo;
respectively (such as <code>strcpy</code> and <code>wcscpy</code>) and look for a
null character to terminate the string instead of requiring an explicit
size argument to be passed.  (Some of these functions accept a specified
maximum length, but they also check for premature termination with a
null character.)  The array arguments and return values for these
functions have type <code>char *</code> and <code>wchar_t *</code> respectively, and
the array elements are referred to as &ldquo;characters&rdquo; and &ldquo;wide
characters&rdquo;.

   <p>In many cases, there are both &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mem</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">str</span></samp>&rsquo;/&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">wcs</span></samp>&rsquo;
versions of a function.  The one that is more appropriate to use depends
on the exact situation.  When your program is manipulating arbitrary
arrays or blocks of storage, then you should always use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mem</span></samp>&rsquo;
functions.  On the other hand, when you are manipulating null-terminated
strings it is usually more convenient to use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">str</span></samp>&rsquo;/&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">wcs</span></samp>&rsquo;
functions, unless you already know the length of the string in advance. 
The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">wmem</span></samp>&rsquo; functions should be used for wide character arrays with
known size.

   <p><a name="index-wint_005ft-470"></a><a name="index-parameter-promotion-471"></a>Some of the memory and string functions take single characters as
arguments.  Since a value of type <code>char</code> is automatically promoted
into an value of type <code>int</code> when used as a parameter, the functions
are declared with <code>int</code> as the type of the parameter in question. 
In case of the wide character function the situation is similarly: the
parameter type for a single wide character is <code>wint_t</code> and not
<code>wchar_t</code>.  This would for many implementations not be necessary
since the <code>wchar_t</code> is large enough to not be automatically
promoted, but since the ISO&nbsp;C<!-- /@w --> standard does not require such a
choice of types the <code>wint_t</code> type is used.
