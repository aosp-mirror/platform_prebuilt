<h3 class="section">6.5 Generic Charset Conversion</h3>

<p>The conversion functions mentioned so far in this chapter all had in
common that they operate on character sets that are not directly
specified by the functions.  The multibyte encoding used is specified by
the currently selected locale for the <code>LC_CTYPE</code> category.  The
wide character set is fixed by the implementation (in the case of GNU C
library it is always UCS-4 encoded ISO&nbsp;10646<!-- /@w -->.

   <p>This has of course several problems when it comes to general character
conversion:

     <ul>
<li>For every conversion where neither the source nor the destination
character set is the character set of the locale for the <code>LC_CTYPE</code>
category, one has to change the <code>LC_CTYPE</code> locale using
<code>setlocale</code>.

     <p>Changing the <code>LC_TYPE</code> locale introduces major problems for the rest
of the programs since several more functions (e.g., the character
classification functions, see <a href="Classification-of-Characters.html#Classification-of-Characters">Classification of Characters</a>) use the
<code>LC_CTYPE</code> category.

     <li>Parallel conversions to and from different character sets are not
possible since the <code>LC_CTYPE</code> selection is global and shared by all
threads.

     <li>If neither the source nor the destination character set is the character
set used for <code>wchar_t</code> representation, there is at least a two-step
process necessary to convert a text using the functions above.  One would
have to select the source character set as the multibyte encoding,
convert the text into a <code>wchar_t</code> text, select the destination
character set as the multibyte encoding, and convert the wide character
text to the multibyte (= destination) character set.

     <p>Even if this is possible (which is not guaranteed) it is a very tiring
work.  Plus it suffers from the other two raised points even more due to
the steady changing of the locale. 
</ul>

   <p>The XPG2 standard defines a completely new set of functions, which has
none of these limitations.  They are not at all coupled to the selected
locales, and they have no constraints on the character sets selected for
source and destination.  Only the set of available conversions limits
them.  The standard does not specify that any conversion at all must be
available.  Such availability is a measure of the quality of the
implementation.

   <p>In the following text first the interface to <code>iconv</code> and then the
conversion function, will be described.  Comparisons with other
implementations will show what obstacles stand in the way of portable
applications.  Finally, the implementation is described in so far as might
interest the advanced user who wants to extend conversion capabilities.
