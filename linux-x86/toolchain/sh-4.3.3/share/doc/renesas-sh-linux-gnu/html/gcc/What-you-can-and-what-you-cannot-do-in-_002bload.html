<h4 class="subsection">7.1.1 What you can and what you cannot do in <code>+load</code></h4>

<p>The <code>+load</code> implementation in the GNU runtime guarantees you the following
things:

     <ul>
<li>you can write whatever C code you like;

     <li>you can send messages to Objective-C constant strings (<code>@"this is a
constant string"</code>);

     <li>you can allocate and send messages to objects whose class is implemented
in the same file;

     <li>the <code>+load</code> implementation of all super classes of a class are executed before the <code>+load</code> of that class is executed;

     <li>the <code>+load</code> implementation of a class is executed before the
<code>+load</code> implementation of any category.

 </ul>

 <p>In particular, the following things, even if they can work in a
particular case, are not guaranteed:

     <ul>
<li>allocation of or sending messages to arbitrary objects;

     <li>allocation of or sending messages to objects whose classes have a
category implemented in the same file;

 </ul>

 <p>You should make no assumptions about receiving <code>+load</code> in sibling
classes when you write <code>+load</code> of a class.  The order in which
sibling classes receive <code>+load</code> is not guaranteed.

 <p>The order in which <code>+load</code> and <code>+initialize</code> are called could
be problematic if this matters.  If you don't allocate objects inside
<code>+load</code>, it is guaranteed that <code>+load</code> is called before
<code>+initialize</code>.  If you create an object inside <code>+load</code> the
<code>+initialize</code> method of object's class is invoked even if
<code>+load</code> was not invoked.  Note if you explicitly call <code>+load</code>
on a class, <code>+initialize</code> will be called first.  To avoid possible
problems try to implement only one of these methods.

 <p>The <code>+load</code> method is also invoked when a bundle is dynamically
loaded into your running program.  This happens automatically without any
intervening operation from you.  When you write bundles and you need to
write <code>+load</code> you can safely create and send messages to objects whose
classes already exist in the running program.  The same restrictions as
above apply to classes defined in bundle.
