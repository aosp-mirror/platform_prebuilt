<h3 class="section">3.8 Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</h3>

<p><a name="index-options-to-control-warnings-219"></a><a name="index-warning-messages-220"></a><a name="index-messages_002c-warning-221"></a><a name="index-suppressing-warnings-222"></a>
Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions which
are not inherently erroneous but which are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.

 <p>The following language-independent options do not enable specific
warnings but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by GCC.

     
<a name="index-syntax-checking-223"></a>
<dl><dt><code>-fsyntax-only</code><dd><a name="index-fsyntax_002donly-224"></a>Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond that.

     <br><dt><code>-w</code><dd><a name="index-w-225"></a>Inhibit all warning messages.

     <br><dt><code>-Werror</code><dd><a name="index-Werror-226"></a><a name="index-Wno_002derror-227"></a>Make all warnings into errors.

     <br><dt><code>-Werror=</code><dd><a name="index-Werror_003d-228"></a><a name="index-Wno_002derror_003d-229"></a>Make the specified warning into an error.  The specifier for a warning
is appended, for example <samp><span class="option">-Werror=switch</span></samp> turns the warnings
controlled by <samp><span class="option">-Wswitch</span></samp> into errors.  This switch takes a
negative form, to be used to negate <samp><span class="option">-Werror</span></samp> for specific
warnings, for example <samp><span class="option">-Wno-error=switch</span></samp> makes
<samp><span class="option">-Wswitch</span></samp> warnings not be errors, even when <samp><span class="option">-Werror</span></samp>
is in effect.  You can use the <samp><span class="option">-fdiagnostics-show-option</span></samp>
option to have each controllable warning amended with the option which
controls it, to determine what to use with this option.

     <p>Note that specifying <samp><span class="option">-Werror=</span></samp><var>foo</var> automatically implies
<samp><span class="option">-W</span></samp><var>foo</var>.  However, <samp><span class="option">-Wno-error=</span></samp><var>foo</var> does not
imply anything.

     <br><dt><code>-Wfatal-errors</code><dd><a name="index-Wfatal_002derrors-230"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dfatal_002derrors-231"></a>This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first error
occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing further error
messages.

 </dl>

 <p>You can request many specific warnings with options beginning
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-W</span></samp>&rsquo;, for example <samp><span class="option">-Wimplicit</span></samp> to request warnings on
implicit declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also
has a negative form beginning &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-Wno-</span></samp>&rsquo; to turn off warnings; for
example, <samp><span class="option">-Wno-implicit</span></samp>.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.  For further,
language-specific options also refer to <a href="C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">C++ Dialect Options</a> and
<a href="Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options</a>.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-pedantic</code><dd><a name="index-pedantic-232"></a>Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++;
reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other
programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++.  For ISO C, follows the
version of the ISO C standard specified by any <samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> option used.

     <p>Valid ISO C and ISO C++ programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few will require <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp> or a
<samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> option specifying the required version of ISO C).  However,
without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional C and C++
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-pedantic</span></samp> does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
<code>__extension__</code>.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them. 
See <a href="Alternate-Keywords.html#Alternate-Keywords">Alternate Keywords</a>.

     <p>Some users try to use <samp><span class="option">-pedantic</span></samp> to check programs for strict ISO
C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all&mdash;only those for which
ISO C <em>requires</em> a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.

     <p>A feature to report any failure to conform to ISO C might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from <samp><span class="option">-pedantic</span></samp>.  We don't have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.

     <p>Where the standard specified with <samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> represents a GNU
extended dialect of C, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnu89</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnu99</span></samp>&rsquo;, there is a
corresponding <dfn>base standard</dfn>, the version of ISO C on which the GNU
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from <samp><span class="option">-pedantic</span></samp> are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It would not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified GNU
C dialect, since by definition the GNU dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)

     <br><dt><code>-pedantic-errors</code><dd><a name="index-pedantic_002derrors-233"></a>Like <samp><span class="option">-pedantic</span></samp>, except that errors are produced rather than
warnings.

     <br><dt><code>-Wall</code><dd><a name="index-Wall-234"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dall-235"></a>This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users
consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to
prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros.  This also
enables some language-specific warnings described in <a href="C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">C++ Dialect Options</a> and <a href="Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options</a>.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp> turns on the following warning flags:

     <pre class="smallexample">          -Waddress   
          -Warray-bounds <span class="roman">(only with</span> <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp><span class="roman">)</span>

          -Wreorder   
          -Wreturn-type

          -Wunused-value     
          -Wunused-variable  
          
</pre>
     <p>Note that some warning flags are not implied by <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp>.  Some of
them warn about constructions that users generally do not consider
questionable, but which occasionally you might wish to check for;
others warn about constructions that are necessary or hard to avoid in
some cases, and there is no simple way to modify the code to suppress
the warning. Some of them are enabled by <samp><span class="option">-Wextra</span></samp> but many of
them must be enabled individually.

     <br><dt><code>-Wextra</code><dd><a name="index-W-236"></a><a name="index-Wextra-237"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dextra-238"></a>This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by
<samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp>. (This option used to be called <samp><span class="option">-W</span></samp>.  The older
name is still supported, but the newer name is more descriptive.)

     <pre class="smallexample">          -Wclobbered  
          -Wempty-body  
          -Wignored-qualifiers

          -Wmissing-parameter-type <span class="roman">(C only)</span>  
          -Wold-style-declaration <span class="roman">(C only)</span>  
          -Woverride-init

</pre>
     <p>The option <samp><span class="option">-Wextra</span></samp> also prints warning messages for the
following cases:

          <ul>
<li>A pointer is compared against integer zero with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;=</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;=</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <li>(C++ only) An enumerator and a non-enumerator both appear in a
conditional expression.

          <li>(C++ only) A non-static reference or non-static &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">const</span></samp>&rsquo; member
appears in a class without constructors.

          <li>(C++ only) Ambiguous virtual bases.

          <li>(C++ only) Subscripting an array which has been declared &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">register</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <li>(C++ only) Taking the address of a variable which has been declared
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">register</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <li>(C++ only) A base class is not initialized in a derived class' copy
constructor.

     </ul>

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-import</code><dd><a name="index-Wno_002dimport-239"></a><a name="index-Wimport-240"></a>Inhibit warning messages about the use of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#import</span></samp>&rsquo;.

of error, as programmers often forget that this type is signed on some
machines. 
This warning is enabled by <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wcomment</code><dd><a name="index-Wcomment-243"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dcomment-244"></a>Warn whenever a comment-start sequence &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/*</span></samp>&rsquo; appears in a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/*</span></samp>&rsquo;
comment, or whenever a Backslash-Newline appears in a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">//</span></samp>&rsquo; comment. 
This warning is enabled by <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wformat</code><dd><a name="index-Wformat-245"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dformat-246"></a><a name="index-ffreestanding-247"></a><a name="index-fno_002dbuiltin-248"></a>Check calls to <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code>, etc., to make sure that
the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string
specified, and that the conversions specified in the format string make
sense.  This includes standard functions, and others specified by format
attributes (see <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>), in the <code>printf</code>,
<code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> and <code>strfmon</code> (an X/Open extension,
not in the C standard) families (or other target-specific families). 
Which functions are checked without format attributes having been
specified depends on the standard version selected, and such checks of
functions without the attribute specified are disabled by
<samp><span class="option">-ffreestanding</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-fno-builtin</span></samp>.

     <p>The formats are checked against the format features supported by GNU
libc version 2.2.  These include all ISO C90 and C99 features, as well
as features from the Single Unix Specification and some BSD and GNU
extensions.  Other library implementations may not support all these
features; GCC does not support warning about features that go beyond a
particular library's limitations.  However, if <samp><span class="option">-pedantic</span></samp> is used
with <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp>, warnings will be given about format features not
in the selected standard version (but not for <code>strfmon</code> formats,
since those are not in any version of the C standard).  See <a href="C-Dialect-Options.html#C-Dialect-Options">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>.

     <p>Since <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> also checks for null format arguments for
several functions, <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> also implies <samp><span class="option">-Wnonnull</span></samp>.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> is included in <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp>.  For more control over some
aspects of format checking, the options <samp><span class="option">-Wformat-y2k</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-format-extra-args</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Wno-format-zero-length</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-Wformat-nonliteral</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Wformat-security</span></samp>, and
<samp><span class="option">-Wformat=2</span></samp> are available, but are not included in <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wformat-y2k</code><dd><a name="index-Wformat_002dy2k-249"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dformat_002dy2k-250"></a>If <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> is specified, also warn about <code>strftime</code>
formats which may yield only a two-digit year.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-format-extra-args</code><dd><a name="index-Wno_002dformat_002dextra_002dargs-251"></a><a name="index-Wformat_002dextra_002dargs-252"></a>If <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> is specified, do not warn about excess arguments to a
<code>printf</code> or <code>scanf</code> format function.  The C standard specifies
that such arguments are ignored.

     <p>Where the unused arguments lie between used arguments that are
specified with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; operand number specifications, normally
warnings are still given, since the implementation could not know what
type to pass to <code>va_arg</code> to skip the unused arguments.  However,
in the case of <code>scanf</code> formats, this option will suppress the
warning if the unused arguments are all pointers, since the Single
Unix Specification says that such unused arguments are allowed.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-format-zero-length </code><span class="roman">(C and Objective-C only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wno_002dformat_002dzero_002dlength-253"></a><a name="index-Wformat_002dzero_002dlength-254"></a>If <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> is specified, do not warn about zero-length formats. 
The C standard specifies that zero-length formats are allowed.

     <br><dt><code>-Wformat-nonliteral</code><dd><a name="index-Wformat_002dnonliteral-255"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dformat_002dnonliteral-256"></a>If <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> is specified, also warn if the format string is not a
string literal and so cannot be checked, unless the format function
takes its format arguments as a <code>va_list</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wformat-security</code><dd><a name="index-Wformat_002dsecurity-257"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dformat_002dsecurity-258"></a>If <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> is specified, also warn about uses of format
functions that represent possible security problems.  At present, this
warns about calls to <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code> functions where the
format string is not a string literal and there are no format arguments,
as in <code>printf (foo);</code>.  This may be a security hole if the format
string came from untrusted input and contains &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%n</span></samp>&rsquo;.  (This is
currently a subset of what <samp><span class="option">-Wformat-nonliteral</span></samp> warns about, but
in future warnings may be added to <samp><span class="option">-Wformat-security</span></samp> that are not
included in <samp><span class="option">-Wformat-nonliteral</span></samp>.)

     <br><dt><code>-Wformat=2</code><dd><a name="index-Wformat_003d2-259"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dformat_003d2-260"></a>Enable <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> plus format checks not included in
<samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp>.  Currently equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-Wformat
-Wformat-nonliteral -Wformat-security -Wformat-y2k</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>-Wnonnull </code><span class="roman">(C and Objective-C only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wnonnull-261"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dnonnull-262"></a>Warn about passing a null pointer for arguments marked as
requiring a non-null value by the <code>nonnull</code> function attribute.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-Wnonnull</span></samp> is included in <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp>.  It
can be disabled with the <samp><span class="option">-Wno-nonnull</span></samp> option.

     <br><dt><code>-Winit-self </code><span class="roman">(C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Winit_002dself-263"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dinit_002dself-264"></a>Warn about uninitialized variables which are initialized with themselves. 
Note this option can only be used with the <samp><span class="option">-Wuninitialized</span></samp> option,
which in turn only works with <samp><span class="option">-O1</span></samp> and above.

     <p>For example, GCC will warn about <code>i</code> being uninitialized in the
following snippet only when <samp><span class="option">-Winit-self</span></samp> has been specified:
     <pre class="smallexample">          int f()
          {
            int i = i;
            return i;
          }
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>-Wimplicit-int </code><span class="roman">(C and Objective-C only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wimplicit_002dint-265"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dimplicit_002dint-266"></a>Warn when a declaration does not specify a type. 
This warning is enabled by <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wimplicit-function-declaration </code><span class="roman">(C and Objective-C only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wimplicit_002dfunction_002ddeclaration-267"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dimplicit_002dfunction_002ddeclaration-268"></a>Give a warning whenever a function is used before being declared. In
C99 mode (<samp><span class="option">-std=c99</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-std=gnu99</span></samp>), this warning is
enabled by default and it is made into an error by
<samp><span class="option">-pedantic-errors</span></samp>. This warning is also enabled by
<samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wimplicit</code><dd><a name="index-Wimplicit-269"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dimplicit-270"></a>Same as <samp><span class="option">-Wimplicit-int</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-Wimplicit-function-declaration</span></samp>. 
This warning is enabled by <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wignored-qualifiers </code><span class="roman">(C and C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wignored_002dqualifiers-271"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dignored_002dqualifiers-272"></a>Warn if the return type of a function has a type qualifier
such as <code>const</code>.  For ISO C such a type qualifier has no effect,
since the value returned by a function is not an lvalue. 
For C++, the warning is only emitted for scalar types or <code>void</code>. 
ISO C prohibits qualified <code>void</code> return types on function
definitions, so such return types always receive a warning
even without this option.

     <p>This warning is also enabled by <samp><span class="option">-Wextra</span></samp>.

of sequence point rules in the C and C++ standards.

     <p>The C and C++ standards defines the order in which expressions in a C/C++
program are evaluated in terms of <dfn>sequence points</dfn>, which represent
a partial ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those
executed before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These
occur after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part
of a larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
<code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>? :</code> or <code>,</code> (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places. 
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.

     <p>It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C and C++ standards specify that &ldquo;Between
the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression. 
Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value
to be stored.&rdquo;.  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.

     <p>Examples of code with undefined behavior are <code>a = a++;</code>, <code>a[n]
= b[n++]</code> and <code>a[i++] = i;</code>.  Some more complicated cases are not
diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting
this sort of problem in programs.

     <p>The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases. 
Links to discussions of the problem, including proposed formal
definitions, may be found on the GCC readings page, at

     <p>These warnings are possible only in optimizing compilation,
because they require data flow information that is computed only
when optimizing.  If you do not specify <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>, you will not get
these warnings. Instead, GCC will issue a warning about <samp><span class="option">-Wuninitialized</span></samp>

     <p>If you want to warn about code which uses the uninitialized value of the

     <p>These warnings occur for individual uninitialized or clobbered
elements of structure, union or array variables as well as for
variables which are uninitialized or clobbered as a whole.  They do
not occur for variables or elements declared <code>volatile</code>.  Because
these warnings depend on optimization, the exact variables or elements
for which there are warnings will depend on the precise optimization
options and version of GCC used.

     <p>Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used only
to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the warnings
are printed.

     <p>These warnings are made optional because GCC is not smart
enough to see all the reasons why the code might be correct
despite appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how
this can happen:

     <pre class="smallexample">          {
            int x;
            switch (y)
              {

                break;
              case 3: x = 5;
              }
            foo (x);
          }
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">If the value of <code>y</code> is always 1, 2 or 3, then <code>x</code> is
always initialized, but GCC doesn't know this.  Here is
another common case:

     <pre class="smallexample">          {
            int save_y;
            if (change_y) save_y = y, y = new_y;
            ...
            if (change_y) y = save_y;
          }
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">This has no bug because <code>save_y</code> is used only if it is set.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007blongjmp_007d-warnings-307"></a>This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might be
changed by a call to <code>longjmp</code>.  These warnings as well are possible
only in optimizing compilation.

     <p>The compiler sees only the calls to <code>setjmp</code>.  It cannot know
where <code>longjmp</code> will be called; in fact, a signal handler could
call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
even when there is in fact no problem because <code>longjmp</code> cannot
in fact be called at the place which would cause a problem.

     <p>Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions
you use that never return as <code>noreturn</code>.  See <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>.

It warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the
assumption that signed overflow does not occur.  Note that it does not
warn about all cases where the code might overflow: it only warns
about cases where the compiler implements some optimization.  Thus
this warning depends on the optimization level.

     <p>An optimization which assumes that signed overflow does not occur is
perfectly safe if the values of the variables involved are such that
overflow never does, in fact, occur.  Therefore this warning can
easily give a false positive: a warning about code which is not
actually a problem.  To help focus on important issues, several
warning levels are defined.  No warnings are issued for the use of
undefined signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop
will require, in particular when determining whether a loop will be
executed at all.

zero.  <samp><span class="option">-Wstrict-overflow</span></samp> (with no level) is the same as

          <br><dt><code>-Wstrict-overflow=3</code><dd>Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified.  For

          <br><dt><code>-Wstrict-overflow=5</code><dd>Also warn about cases where the compiler reduces the magnitude of a
constant involved in a comparison.  For example: <code>x + 2 &gt; y</code> will
be simplified to <code>x + 1 &gt;= y</code>.  This is reported only at the

     <p>The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the

infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you need
to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that's a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
would check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.

          <li>The unary plus operator.

          <li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">U</span></samp>&rsquo; integer constant suffix, or the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>&rsquo; floating point
constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>&rsquo; suffix on integer
constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros defined in the system
headers of most modern systems, e.g. the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_MIN</span></samp>&rsquo;/&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_MAX</span></samp>&rsquo; macros in <code>&lt;limits.h&gt;</code>. 
Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious
warnings, however GCC's integrated preprocessor has enough context to
avoid warning in these cases.

          <li>A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of
the block.

          <li>A <code>switch</code> statement has an operand of type <code>long</code>.

          <li>A non-<code>static</code> function declaration follows a <code>static</code> one. 
This construct is not accepted by some traditional C compilers.

          <li>The ISO type of an integer constant has a different width or
signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is only issued if
the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal or octal values, which
typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.

          <li>Usage of ISO string concatenation is detected.

          <li>Initialization of automatic aggregates.

          <li>Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate
namespace for labels.

          <li>Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the warning is
omitted.  This is done under the assumption that the zero initializer in
user code appears conditioned on e.g. <code>__STDC__</code> to avoid missing
initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero in the
traditional C case.

          <li>Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating point values and vice
versa.  The absence of these prototypes when compiling with traditional
C would cause serious problems.  This is a subset of the possible
conversion warnings, for the full set use <samp><span class="option">-Wtraditional-conversion</span></samp>.

          <li>Use of ISO C style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is
<em>not</em> issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions
because these ISO C features will appear in your code when using
libiberty's traditional C compatibility macros, <code>PARAMS</code> and
<code>VPARAMS</code>.  This warning is also bypassed for nested functions
because that feature is already a GCC extension and thus not relevant to
traditional C compatibility.

GCC will guess that function pointers with <code>format</code> attributes that

     <p>GCC will also warn about function definitions which might be
candidates for <code>format</code> attributes.  Again, these are only
possible candidates.  GCC will guess that <code>format</code> attributes
might be appropriate for any function that calls a function like

different sequences of characters.  However, sometimes when characters
outside the basic ASCII character set are used, you can have two
different character sequences that look the same.  To avoid confusion,
the ISO 10646 standard sets out some <dfn>normalization rules</dfn> which
when applied ensure that two sequences that look the same are turned into
the same sequence.  GCC can warn you if you are using identifiers which
have not been normalized; this option controls that warning.

     <p>There are four levels of warning that GCC supports.  The default is
<samp><span class="option">-Wnormalized=nfc</span></samp>, which warns about any identifier which is
not in the ISO 10646 &ldquo;C&rdquo; normalized form, <dfn>NFC</dfn>.  NFC is the
recommended form for most uses.

     <p>Unfortunately, there are some characters which ISO C and ISO C++ allow
in identifiers that when turned into NFC aren't allowable as
identifiers.  That is, there's no way to use these symbols in portable
ISO C or C++ and have all your identifiers in NFC. 
<samp><span class="option">-Wnormalized=id</span></samp> suppresses the warning for these characters. 
It is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will correct
this, which is why this option is not the default.

     <p>You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing
<samp><span class="option">-Wnormalized=none</span></samp>.  You would only want to do this if you
were using some other normalization scheme (like &ldquo;D&rdquo;), because
otherwise you can easily create bugs that are literally impossible to see.

     <p>Some characters in ISO 10646 have distinct meanings but look identical
in some fonts or display methodologies, especially once formatting has
been applied.  For instance <code>\u207F</code>, &ldquo;SUPERSCRIPT LATIN SMALL
LETTER N&rdquo;, will display just like a regular <code>n</code> which has been
placed in a superscript.  ISO 10646 defines the <dfn>NFKC</dfn>
normalization scheme to convert all these into a standard form as
well, and GCC will warn if your code is not in NFKC if you use
<samp><span class="option">-Wnormalized=nfkc</span></samp>.  This warning is comparable to warning
about every identifier that contains the letter O because it might be
confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but may be
useful as a local coding convention if the programming environment is
unable to be fixed to display these characters distinctly.

     <p>This option is intended to warn when the compiler detects that at
least a whole line of source code will never be executed, because
some condition is never satisfied or because it is after a
procedure that never returns.

     <p>It is possible for this option to produce a warning even though there
are circumstances under which part of the affected line can be executed,
so care should be taken when removing apparently-unreachable code.

     <p>For instance, when a function is inlined, a warning may mean that the
line is unreachable in only one inlined copy of the function.

     <p>This option is not made part of <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp> because in a debugging
version of a program there is often substantial code which checks
correct functioning of the program and is, hopefully, unreachable
because the program does work.  Another common use of unreachable
code is to provide behavior which is selectable at compile-time.

     <br><dt><code>-Winline</code><dd><a name="index-Winline-428"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dinline-429"></a>Warn if a function can not be inlined and it was declared as inline. 
Even with this option, the compiler will not warn about failures to
inline functions declared in system headers.

     <p>The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not
to inline a function.  For example, the compiler takes into account
the size of the function being inlined and the amount of inlining
that has already been done in the current function.  Therefore,
seemingly insignificant changes in the source program can cause the
warnings produced by <samp><span class="option">-Winline</span></samp> to appear or disappear.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-invalid-offsetof </code><span class="roman">(C++ and Objective-C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wno_002dinvalid_002doffsetof-430"></a><a name="index-Winvalid_002doffsetof-431"></a>Suppress warnings from applying the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">offsetof</span></samp>&rsquo; macro to a non-POD
type.  According to the 1998 ISO C++ standard, applying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">offsetof</span></samp>&rsquo;
to a non-POD type is undefined.  In existing C++ implementations,
however, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">offsetof</span></samp>&rsquo; typically gives meaningful results even when
applied to certain kinds of non-POD types. (Such as a simple
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">struct</span></samp>&rsquo; that fails to be a POD type only by virtue of having a
constructor.)  This flag is for users who are aware that they are
writing nonportable code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore the
warning about it.

     <p>The restrictions on &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">offsetof</span></samp>&rsquo; may be relaxed in a future version
of the C++ standard.

not count the trailing NUL.  In C89, the limit was 509 characters; in
C99, it was raised to 4095.  C++98 does not specify a normative
minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose overlength strings in C++.
