<h3 class="section">5.36 An Inline Function is As Fast As a Macro</h3>

<p><a name="index-inline-functions-2252"></a><a name="index-integrating-function-code-2253"></a><a name="index-open-coding-2254"></a><a name="index-macros_002c-inline-alternative-2255"></a>
By declaring a function inline, you can direct GCC to make
calls to that function faster.  One way GCC can achieve this is to
integrate that function's code into the code for its callers.  This
makes execution faster by eliminating the function-call overhead; in
addition, if any of the actual argument values are constant, their
known values may permit simplifications at compile time so that not
all of the inline function's code needs to be included.  The effect on
code size is less predictable; object code may be larger or smaller
with function inlining, depending on the particular case.  You can
also direct GCC to try to integrate all &ldquo;simple enough&rdquo; functions
into their callers with the option <samp><span class="option">-finline-functions</span></samp>.

 <p>GCC implements three different semantics of declaring a function
inline.  One is available with <samp><span class="option">-std=gnu89</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">-fgnu89-inline</span></samp> or when <code>gnu_inline</code> attribute is present
on all inline declarations, another when <samp><span class="option">-std=c99</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">-std=gnu99</span></samp> (without <samp><span class="option">-fgnu89-inline</span></samp>), and the third
is used when compiling C++.

 <p>To declare a function inline, use the <code>inline</code> keyword in its
declaration, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     static inline int
     inc (int *a)
     {
       (*a)++;
     }
</pre>
 <p>If you are writing a header file to be included in ISO C89 programs, write
<code>__inline__</code> instead of <code>inline</code>.  See <a href="Alternate-Keywords.html#Alternate-Keywords">Alternate Keywords</a>.

 <p>The three types of inlining behave similarly in two important cases:
when the <code>inline</code> keyword is used on a <code>static</code> function,
like the example above, and when a function is first declared without
using the <code>inline</code> keyword and then is defined with
<code>inline</code>, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     extern int inc (int *a);
     inline int
     inc (int *a)
     {
       (*a)++;
     }
</pre>
 <p>In both of these common cases, the program behaves the same as if you
had not used the <code>inline</code> keyword, except for its speed.

 <p><a name="index-inline-functions_002c-omission-of-2256"></a><a name="index-fkeep_002dinline_002dfunctions-2257"></a>When a function is both inline and <code>static</code>, if all calls to the
function are integrated into the caller, and the function's address is
never used, then the function's own assembler code is never referenced. 
In this case, GCC does not actually output assembler code for the
function, unless you specify the option <samp><span class="option">-fkeep-inline-functions</span></samp>. 
Some calls cannot be integrated for various reasons (in particular,
calls that precede the function's definition cannot be integrated, and
neither can recursive calls within the definition).  If there is a
nonintegrated call, then the function is compiled to assembler code as
usual.  The function must also be compiled as usual if the program
refers to its address, because that can't be inlined.

 <p><a name="index-Winline-2258"></a>Note that certain usages in a function definition can make it unsuitable
for inline substitution.  Among these usages are: use of varargs, use of
alloca, use of variable sized data types (see <a href="Variable-Length.html#Variable-Length">Variable Length</a>),
use of computed goto (see <a href="Labels-as-Values.html#Labels-as-Values">Labels as Values</a>), use of nonlocal goto,
and nested functions (see <a href="Nested-Functions.html#Nested-Functions">Nested Functions</a>).  Using <samp><span class="option">-Winline</span></samp>
will warn when a function marked <code>inline</code> could not be substituted,
and will give the reason for the failure.

 <p><a name="index-automatic-_0040code_007binline_007d-for-C_002b_002b-member-fns-2259"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007binline_007d-automatic-for-C_002b_002b-member-fns-2260"></a><a name="index-member-fns_002c-automatically-_0040code_007binline_007d-2261"></a><a name="index-C_002b_002b-member-fns_002c-automatically-_0040code_007binline_007d-2262"></a><a name="index-fno_002ddefault_002dinline-2263"></a>As required by ISO C++, GCC considers member functions defined within
the body of a class to be marked inline even if they are
not explicitly declared with the <code>inline</code> keyword.  You can
override this with <samp><span class="option">-fno-default-inline</span></samp>; see <a href="C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">Options Controlling C++ Dialect</a>.

 <p>GCC does not inline any functions when not optimizing unless you specify
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">always_inline</span></samp>&rsquo; attribute for the function, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     /* <span class="roman">Prototype.</span>  */
     inline void foo (const char) __attribute__((always_inline));
</pre>
 <p>The remainder of this section is specific to GNU C89 inlining.

 <p><a name="index-non_002dstatic-inline-function-2264"></a>When an inline function is not <code>static</code>, then the compiler must assume
that there may be calls from other source files; since a global symbol can
be defined only once in any program, the function must not be defined in
the other source files, so the calls therein cannot be integrated. 
Therefore, a non-<code>static</code> inline function is always compiled on its
own in the usual fashion.

 <p>If you specify both <code>inline</code> and <code>extern</code> in the function
definition, then the definition is used only for inlining.  In no case
is the function compiled on its own, not even if you refer to its
address explicitly.  Such an address becomes an external reference, as
if you had only declared the function, and had not defined it.

 <p>This combination of <code>inline</code> and <code>extern</code> has almost the
effect of a macro.  The way to use it is to put a function definition in
a header file with these keywords, and put another copy of the
definition (lacking <code>inline</code> and <code>extern</code>) in a library file. 
The definition in the header file will cause most calls to the function
to be inlined.  If any uses of the function remain, they will refer to
the single copy in the library.
