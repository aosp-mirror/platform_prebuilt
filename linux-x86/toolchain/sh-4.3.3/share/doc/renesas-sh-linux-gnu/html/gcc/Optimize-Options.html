<h3 class="section">3.10 Options That Control Optimization</h3>

<p><a name="index-optimize-options-610"></a><a name="index-options_002c-optimization-611"></a>
These options control various sorts of optimizations.

 <p>Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any
variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the
function and get exactly the results you would expect from the source
code.

 <p>Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
and possibly the ability to debug the program.

 <p>The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of
the program.  Optimization levels <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and above, in
particular, enable <em>unit-at-a-time</em> mode, which allows the
compiler to consider information gained from later functions in
the file when compiling a function.  Compiling multiple files at
once to a single output file in <em>unit-at-a-time</em> mode allows
the compiler to use information gained from all of the files when
compiling each of them.

 <p>Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-O</code><dt><code>-O1</code><dd><a name="index-O-612"></a><a name="index-O1-613"></a>Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
more memory for a large function.

     <p>With <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of
compilation time.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> turns on the following optimization flags:
     <pre class="smallexample">          -fauto-inc-dec 
          -fcprop-registers 
          -fdce 
          -fdefer-pop 
          -fdelayed-branch 
          -fdse 
          -fguess-branch-probability 
          -fif-conversion2 
          -fif-conversion 
          -finline-small-functions 
          -fipa-pure-const 
          -fipa-reference 
          -fmerge-constants
          -fsplit-wide-types 
          -ftree-ccp 
          -ftree-ch 
          -ftree-copyrename 
          -ftree-dce 
          -ftree-dominator-opts 
          -ftree-dse 
          -ftree-fre 
          -ftree-sra 
          -ftree-ter 
          -funit-at-a-time
</pre>
     <p><samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> also turns on <samp><span class="option">-fomit-frame-pointer</span></samp> on machines
where doing so does not interfere with debugging.

     <br><dt><code>-O2</code><dd><a name="index-O2-614"></a>Optimize even more.  GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations
that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.  The compiler does not
perform loop unrolling or function inlining when you specify <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>. 
As compared to <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>, this option increases both compilation time
and the performance of the generated code.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> turns on all optimization flags specified by <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>.  It
also turns on the following optimization flags:
     <pre class="smallexample">          -fthread-jumps 
          -falign-functions  -falign-jumps 
          -falign-loops  -falign-labels 
          -fcaller-saves 
          -fcrossjumping 
          -fcse-follow-jumps  -fcse-skip-blocks 
          -fdelete-null-pointer-checks 
          -fexpensive-optimizations 
          -fgcse  -fgcse-lm  
          -foptimize-sibling-calls 
          -fpeephole2 
          -fregmove 
          -freorder-blocks  -freorder-functions 
          -frerun-cse-after-loop  
          -fsched-interblock  -fsched-spec 
          -fschedule-insns  -fschedule-insns2 
          -fstrict-aliasing -fstrict-overflow 
          -ftree-pre 
          -ftree-vrp
</pre>
     <p>Please note the warning under <samp><span class="option">-fgcse</span></samp> about
invoking <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> on programs that use computed gotos.

     <br><dt><code>-O3</code><dd><a name="index-O3-615"></a>Optimize yet more.  <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp> turns on all optimizations specified by
<samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> and also turns on the <samp><span class="option">-finline-functions</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-funswitch-loops</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fpredictive-commoning</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-fgcse-after-reload</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-ftree-vectorize</span></samp>
options.

     <br><dt><code>-O0</code><dd><a name="index-O0-616"></a>Reduce compilation time and make debugging produce the expected
results.  This is the default.

     <br><dt><code>-Os</code><dd><a name="index-Os-617"></a>Optimize for size.  <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp> enables all <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> optimizations that
do not typically increase code size.  It also performs further
optimizations designed to reduce code size.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp> disables the following optimization flags:
     <pre class="smallexample">          -falign-functions  -falign-jumps  -falign-loops 
          -falign-labels  -freorder-blocks  -freorder-blocks-and-partition 
          -fprefetch-loop-arrays  -ftree-vect-loop-version
</pre>
     <p>If you use multiple <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> options, with or without level numbers,
the last such option is the one that is effective. 
</dl>

 <p>Options of the form <samp><span class="option">-f</span><var>flag</var></samp> specify machine-independent
flags.  Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative
form of <samp><span class="option">-ffoo</span></samp> would be <samp><span class="option">-fno-foo</span></samp>.  In the table
below, only one of the forms is listed&mdash;the one you typically will
use.  You can figure out the other form by either removing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">no-</span></samp>&rsquo;
or adding it.

 <p>The following options control specific optimizations.  They are either
activated by <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> options or are related to ones that are.  You
can use the following flags in the rare cases when &ldquo;fine-tuning&rdquo; of
optimizations to be performed is desired.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fno-default-inline</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002ddefault_002dinline-618"></a>Do not make member functions inline by default merely because they are
defined inside the class scope (C++ only).  Otherwise, when you specify
<samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp><!-- /@w -->, member functions defined inside class scope are compiled
inline by default; i.e., you don't need to add &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">inline</span></samp>&rsquo; in front of
the member function name.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-defer-pop</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002ddefer_002dpop-619"></a>Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that function
returns.  For machines which must pop arguments after a function call,
the compiler normally lets arguments accumulate on the stack for several
function calls and pops them all at once.

     <p>Disabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fforward-propagate</code><dd><a name="index-fforward_002dpropagate-620"></a>Perform a forward propagation pass on RTL.  The pass tries to combine two
instructions and checks if the result can be simplified.  If loop unrolling
is active, two passes are performed and the second is scheduled after
loop unrolling.

     <p>This option is enabled by default at optimization levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code><dd><a name="index-fomit_002dframe_002dpointer-621"></a>Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that
don't need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available
in many functions.  <strong>It also makes debugging impossible on
some machines.</strong>

     <p>On some machines, such as the VAX, this flag has no effect, because
the standard calling sequence automatically handles the frame pointer
and nothing is saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The
machine-description macro <code>FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED</code> controls
whether a target machine supports this flag.  See <a href="../gccint/Registers.html#Registers">Register Usage</a>.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-foptimize-sibling-calls</code><dd><a name="index-foptimize_002dsibling_002dcalls-622"></a>Optimize sibling and tail recursive calls.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-inline</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dinline-623"></a>Don't pay attention to the <code>inline</code> keyword.  Normally this option
is used to keep the compiler from expanding any functions inline. 
Note that if you are not optimizing, no functions can be expanded inline.

     <br><dt><code>-finline-small-functions</code><dd><a name="index-finline_002dsmall_002dfunctions-624"></a>Integrate functions into their callers when their body is smaller than expected
function call code (so overall size of program gets smaller).  The compiler
heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth integrating
in this way.

     <p>Enabled at level <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-finline-functions</code><dd><a name="index-finline_002dfunctions-625"></a>Integrate all simple functions into their callers.  The compiler
heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth
integrating in this way.

     <p>If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function is
declared <code>static</code>, then the function is normally not output as
assembler code in its own right.

     <p>Enabled at level <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-finline-functions-called-once</code><dd><a name="index-finline_002dfunctions_002dcalled_002donce-626"></a>Consider all <code>static</code> functions called once for inlining into their
caller even if they are not marked <code>inline</code>.  If a call to a given
function is integrated, then the function is not output as assembler code
in its own right.

     <p>Enabled if <samp><span class="option">-funit-at-a-time</span></samp> is enabled.

     <br><dt><code>-fearly-inlining</code><dd><a name="index-fearly_002dinlining-627"></a>Inline functions marked by <code>always_inline</code> and functions whose body seems
smaller than the function call overhead early before doing
<samp><span class="option">-fprofile-generate</span></samp> instrumentation and real inlining pass.  Doing so
makes profiling significantly cheaper and usually inlining faster on programs
having large chains of nested wrapper functions.

     <p>Enabled by default.

     <br><dt><code>-finline-limit=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-finline_002dlimit-628"></a>By default, GCC limits the size of functions that can be inlined.  This flag
allows coarse control of this limit.  <var>n</var> is the size of functions that
can be inlined in number of pseudo instructions.

     <p>Inlining is actually controlled by a number of parameters, which may be
specified individually by using <samp><span class="option">--param </span><var>name</var><span class="option">=</span><var>value</var></samp>. 
The <samp><span class="option">-finline-limit=</span><var>n</var></samp> option sets some of these parameters
as follows:

          <dl>
<dt><code>max-inline-insns-single</code><dd>is set to <var>n</var>/2. 
<br><dt><code>max-inline-insns-auto</code><dd>is set to <var>n</var>/2. 
</dl>

     <p>See below for a documentation of the individual
parameters controlling inlining and for the defaults of these parameters.

     <p><em>Note:</em> there may be no value to <samp><span class="option">-finline-limit</span></samp> that results
in default behavior.

     <p><em>Note:</em> pseudo instruction represents, in this particular context, an
abstract measurement of function's size.  In no way does it represent a count
of assembly instructions and as such its exact meaning might change from one
release to an another.

     <br><dt><code>-fkeep-inline-functions</code><dd><a name="index-fkeep_002dinline_002dfunctions-629"></a>In C, emit <code>static</code> functions that are declared <code>inline</code>
into the object file, even if the function has been inlined into all
of its callers.  This switch does not affect functions using the
<code>extern inline</code> extension in GNU C89.  In C++, emit any and all
inline functions into the object file.

     <br><dt><code>-fkeep-static-consts</code><dd><a name="index-fkeep_002dstatic_002dconsts-630"></a>Emit variables declared <code>static const</code> when optimization isn't turned
on, even if the variables aren't referenced.

     <p>GCC enables this option by default.  If you want to force the compiler to
check if the variable was referenced, regardless of whether or not
optimization is turned on, use the <samp><span class="option">-fno-keep-static-consts</span></samp> option.

     <br><dt><code>-fmerge-constants</code><dd><a name="index-fmerge_002dconstants-631"></a>Attempt to merge identical constants (string constants and floating point
constants) across compilation units.

     <p>This option is the default for optimized compilation if the assembler and
linker support it.  Use <samp><span class="option">-fno-merge-constants</span></samp> to inhibit this
behavior.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fmerge-all-constants</code><dd><a name="index-fmerge_002dall_002dconstants-632"></a>Attempt to merge identical constants and identical variables.

     <p>This option implies <samp><span class="option">-fmerge-constants</span></samp>.  In addition to
<samp><span class="option">-fmerge-constants</span></samp> this considers e.g. even constant initialized
arrays or initialized constant variables with integral or floating point
types.  Languages like C or C++ require each non-automatic variable to
have distinct location, so using this option will result in non-conforming
behavior.

     <br><dt><code>-fmodulo-sched</code><dd><a name="index-fmodulo_002dsched-633"></a>Perform swing modulo scheduling immediately before the first scheduling
pass.  This pass looks at innermost loops and reorders their
instructions by overlapping different iterations.

     <br><dt><code>-fmodulo-sched-allow-regmoves</code><dd><a name="index-fmodulo_002dsched_002dallow_002dregmoves-634"></a>Perform more aggressive SMS based modulo scheduling with register moves
allowed.  By setting this flag certain anti-dependences edges will be
deleted which will trigger the generation of reg-moves based on the
life-range analysis.  This option is effective only with
<samp><span class="option">-fmodulo-sched</span></samp> enabled.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-branch-count-reg</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dbranch_002dcount_002dreg-635"></a>Do not use &ldquo;decrement and branch&rdquo; instructions on a count register,
but instead generate a sequence of instructions that decrement a
register, compare it against zero, then branch based upon the result. 
This option is only meaningful on architectures that support such
instructions, which include x86, PowerPC, IA-64 and S/390.

     <p>The default is <samp><span class="option">-fbranch-count-reg</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-function-cse</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dfunction_002dcse-636"></a>Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction that
calls a constant function contain the function's address explicitly.

     <p>This option results in less efficient code, but some strange hacks
that alter the assembler output may be confused by the optimizations
performed when this option is not used.

     <p>The default is <samp><span class="option">-ffunction-cse</span></samp>

     <br><dt><code>-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dzero_002dinitialized_002din_002dbss-637"></a>If the target supports a BSS section, GCC by default puts variables that
are initialized to zero into BSS.  This can save space in the resulting
code.

     <p>This option turns off this behavior because some programs explicitly
rely on variables going to the data section.  E.g., so that the
resulting executable can find the beginning of that section and/or make
assumptions based on that.

     <p>The default is <samp><span class="option">-fzero-initialized-in-bss</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fmudflap -fmudflapth -fmudflapir</code><dd><a name="index-fmudflap-638"></a><a name="index-fmudflapth-639"></a><a name="index-fmudflapir-640"></a><a name="index-bounds-checking-641"></a><a name="index-mudflap-642"></a>For front-ends that support it (C and C++), instrument all risky
pointer/array dereferencing operations, some standard library
string/heap functions, and some other associated constructs with
range/validity tests.  Modules so instrumented should be immune to
buffer overflows, invalid heap use, and some other classes of C/C++
programming errors.  The instrumentation relies on a separate runtime
library (<samp><span class="file">libmudflap</span></samp>), which will be linked into a program if
<samp><span class="option">-fmudflap</span></samp> is given at link time.  Run-time behavior of the
instrumented program is controlled by the <samp><span class="env">MUDFLAP_OPTIONS</span></samp>
environment variable.  See <code>env MUDFLAP_OPTIONS=-help a.out</code>
for its options.

     <p>Use <samp><span class="option">-fmudflapth</span></samp> instead of <samp><span class="option">-fmudflap</span></samp> to compile and to
link if your program is multi-threaded.  Use <samp><span class="option">-fmudflapir</span></samp>, in
addition to <samp><span class="option">-fmudflap</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-fmudflapth</span></samp>, if
instrumentation should ignore pointer reads.  This produces less
instrumentation (and therefore faster execution) and still provides
some protection against outright memory corrupting writes, but allows
erroneously read data to propagate within a program.

     <br><dt><code>-fthread-jumps</code><dd><a name="index-fthread_002djumps-643"></a>Perform optimizations where we check to see if a jump branches to a
location where another comparison subsumed by the first is found.  If
so, the first branch is redirected to either the destination of the
second branch or a point immediately following it, depending on whether
the condition is known to be true or false.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fsplit-wide-types</code><dd><a name="index-fsplit_002dwide_002dtypes-644"></a>When using a type that occupies multiple registers, such as <code>long
long</code> on a 32-bit system, split the registers apart and allocate them
independently.  This normally generates better code for those types,
but may make debugging more difficult.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fcse-follow-jumps</code><dd><a name="index-fcse_002dfollow_002djumps-645"></a>In common subexpression elimination (CSE), scan through jump instructions
when the target of the jump is not reached by any other path.  For
example, when CSE encounters an <code>if</code> statement with an
<code>else</code> clause, CSE will follow the jump when the condition
tested is false.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fcse-skip-blocks</code><dd><a name="index-fcse_002dskip_002dblocks-646"></a>This is similar to <samp><span class="option">-fcse-follow-jumps</span></samp>, but causes CSE to
follow jumps which conditionally skip over blocks.  When CSE
encounters a simple <code>if</code> statement with no else clause,
<samp><span class="option">-fcse-skip-blocks</span></samp> causes CSE to follow the jump around the
body of the <code>if</code>.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-frerun-cse-after-loop</code><dd><a name="index-frerun_002dcse_002dafter_002dloop-647"></a>Re-run common subexpression elimination after loop optimizations has been
performed.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fgcse</code><dd><a name="index-fgcse-648"></a>Perform a global common subexpression elimination pass. 
This pass also performs global constant and copy propagation.

     <p><em>Note:</em> When compiling a program using computed gotos, a GCC
extension, you may get better runtime performance if you disable
the global common subexpression elimination pass by adding

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-fre</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dfre-680"></a>Perform full redundancy elimination (FRE) on trees.  The difference
between FRE and PRE is that FRE only considers expressions
that are computed on all paths leading to the redundant computation. 
This analysis is faster than PRE, though it exposes fewer redundancies. 
This flag is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and higher.

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-copy-prop</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dcopy_002dprop-681"></a>Perform copy propagation on trees.  This pass eliminates unnecessary

This optimization analyzes the program to determine when values passed

it may significantly increase code size.

     <br><dt><code>-fipa-matrix-reorg</code><dd><a name="index-fipa_002dmatrix_002dreorg-688"></a>Perform matrix flattening and transposing. 
Matrix flattening tries to replace a m-dimensional matrix

This reduces the level of indirection needed for accessing the elements
of the matrix. The second optimization is matrix transposing that
attemps to change the order of the matrix's dimensions in order to
improve cache locality. 
Both optimizations need fwhole-program flag. 
Transposing is enabled only if profiling information is avaliable.

propagation, redundancy elimination, range propagation and expression
simplification) based on a dominator tree traversal.  This also
performs jump threading (to reduce jumps to jumps). This flag is
enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and higher.

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-dse</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002ddse-694"></a>Perform dead store elimination (DSE) on trees.  A dead store is a store into
a memory location which will later be overwritten by another store without

flag is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and higher.

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-ch</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dch-695"></a>Perform loop header copying on trees.  This is beneficial since it increases
effectiveness of code motion optimizations.  It also saves one jump.  This flag
is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and higher.  It is not enabled
for <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>, since it usually increases code size.

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-loop-optimize</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dloop_002doptimize-696"></a>Perform loop optimizations on trees.  This flag is enabled by default

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-loop-linear</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dloop_002dlinear-697"></a>Perform linear loop transformations on tree.  This flag can improve cache

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-loop-im</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dloop_002dim-699"></a>Perform loop invariant motion on trees.  This pass moves only invariants that
would be hard to handle at RTL level (function calls, operations that expand to
nontrivial sequences of insns).  With <samp><span class="option">-funswitch-loops</span></samp> it also moves
operands of conditions that are invariant out of the loop, so that we can use
just trivial invariantness analysis in loop unswitching.  The pass also includes
store motion.

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-loop-ivcanon</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dloop_002divcanon-700"></a>Create a canonical counter for number of iterations in the loop for that
determining number of iterations requires complicated analysis.  Later
optimizations then may determine the number easily.  Useful especially
in connection with unrolling.

     <br><dt><code>-fivopts</code><dd><a name="index-fivopts-701"></a>Perform induction variable optimizations (strength reduction, induction
variable merging and induction variable elimination) on trees.

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-parallelize-loops=n</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dparallelize_002dloops-702"></a>Parallelize loops, i.e., split their iteration space to run in n threads. 
This is only possible for loops whose iterations are independent
and can be arbitrarily reordered.  The optimization is only
profitable on multiprocessor machines, for loops that are CPU-intensive,
rather than constrained e.g. by memory bandwidth.  This option
implies <samp><span class="option">-pthread</span></samp>, and thus is only supported on targets
that have support for <samp><span class="option">-pthread</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-sra</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dsra-703"></a>Perform scalar replacement of aggregates.  This pass replaces structure
references with scalars to prevent committing structures to memory too

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-copyrename</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dcopyrename-704"></a>Perform copy renaming on trees.  This pass attempts to rename compiler
temporaries to other variables at copy locations, usually resulting in
variable names which more closely resemble the original variables.  This flag
is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and higher.

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-ter</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dter-705"></a>Perform temporary expression replacement during the SSA-&gt;normal phase.  Single
use/single def temporaries are replaced at their use location with their
defining expression.  This results in non-GIMPLE code, but gives the expanders
much more complex trees to work on resulting in better RTL generation.  This is
enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and higher.

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-vectorize</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dvectorize-706"></a>Perform loop vectorization on trees. This flag is enabled by default at

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-vect-loop-version</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dvect_002dloop_002dversion-707"></a>Perform loop versioning when doing loop vectorization on trees.  When a loop
appears to be vectorizable except that data alignment or data dependence cannot
be determined at compile time then vectorized and non-vectorized versions of
the loop are generated along with runtime checks for alignment or dependence
to control which version is executed.  This option is enabled by default
except at level <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp> where it is disabled.

     <br><dt><code>-fvect-cost-model</code><dd><a name="index-fvect_002dcost_002dmodel-708"></a>Enable cost model for vectorization.

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-vrp</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dvrp-709"></a>Perform Value Range Propagation on trees.  This is similar to the
constant propagation pass, but instead of values, ranges of values are
propagated.  This allows the optimizers to remove unnecessary range
checks like array bound checks and null pointer checks.  This is
enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> and higher.  Null pointer check
elimination is only done if <samp><span class="option">-fdelete-null-pointer-checks</span></samp> is
enabled.

     <br><dt><code>-ftracer</code><dd><a name="index-ftracer-710"></a>Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size.  This transformation
simplifies the control flow of the function allowing other optimizations to do
better job.

     <br><dt><code>-funroll-loops</code><dd><a name="index-funroll_002dloops-711"></a>Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile
time or upon entry to the loop.  <samp><span class="option">-funroll-loops</span></samp> implies
<samp><span class="option">-frerun-cse-after-loop</span></samp>.  This option makes code larger,
and may or may not make it run faster.

     <br><dt><code>-funroll-all-loops</code><dd><a name="index-funroll_002dall_002dloops-712"></a>Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when
the loop is entered.  This usually makes programs run more slowly. 
<samp><span class="option">-funroll-all-loops</span></samp> implies the same options as
<samp><span class="option">-funroll-loops</span></samp>,

     <br><dt><code>-fsplit-ivs-in-unroller</code><dd><a name="index-fsplit_002divs_002din_002dunroller-713"></a>Enables expressing of values of induction variables in later iterations
of the unrolled loop using the value in the first iteration.  This breaks
long dependency chains, thus improving efficiency of the scheduling passes.

     <p>Combination of <samp><span class="option">-fweb</span></samp> and CSE is often sufficient to obtain the

     <br><dt><code>-fstrict-aliasing</code><dd><a name="index-fstrict_002daliasing-723"></a>Allows the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to
the language being compiled.  For C (and C++), this activates
optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an
object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an
object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For
example, an <code>unsigned int</code> can alias an <code>int</code>, but not a
<code>void*</code> or a <code>double</code>.  A character type may alias any other
type.

     <p><a name="Type_002dpunning"></a>Pay special attention to code like this:
     <pre class="smallexample">          union a_union {
            int i;
            double d;

            t.d = 3.0;
            return t.i;
          }
</pre>
     <p>The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most
recently written to (called &ldquo;type-punning&rdquo;) is common.  Even with
<samp><span class="option">-fstrict-aliasing</span></samp>, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory
is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above will work as
expected.  See <a href="Structures-unions-enumerations-and-bit_002dfields-implementation.html#Structures-unions-enumerations-and-bit_002dfields-implementation">Structures unions enumerations and bit-fields implementation</a>.  However, this code might not:

          }
</pre>
     <p>Similarly, access by taking the address, casting the resulting pointer
and dereferencing the result has undefined behavior, even if the cast
uses a union type, e.g.:

            double d = 3.0;
            return ((union a_union *) &amp;d)-&gt;i;

     <br><dt><code>-fstrict-overflow</code><dd><a name="index-fstrict_002doverflow-724"></a>Allow the compiler to assume strict signed overflow rules, depending
on the language being compiled.  For C (and C++) this means that
overflow when doing arithmetic with signed numbers is undefined, which
means that the compiler may assume that it will not happen.  This
permits various optimizations.  For example, the compiler will assume
that an expression like <code>i + 10 &gt; i</code> will always be true for
signed <code>i</code>.  This assumption is only valid if signed overflow is
undefined, as the expression is false if <code>i + 10</code> overflows when
using twos complement arithmetic.  When this option is in effect any
attempt to determine whether an operation on signed numbers will
overflow must be written carefully to not actually involve overflow.

     <p>This option also allows the compiler to assume strict pointer
semantics: given a pointer to an object, if adding an offset to that
pointer does not produce a pointer to the same object, the addition is
undefined.  This permits the compiler to conclude that <code>p + u &gt;
p</code> is always true for a pointer <code>p</code> and unsigned integer
<code>u</code>.  This assumption is only valid because pointer wraparound is
undefined, as the expression is false if <code>p + u</code> overflows using
twos complement arithmetic.

     <p>See also the <samp><span class="option">-fwrapv</span></samp> option.  Using <samp><span class="option">-fwrapv</span></samp> means
that integer signed overflow is fully defined: it wraps.  When
<samp><span class="option">-fwrapv</span></samp> is used, there is no difference between
<samp><span class="option">-fstrict-overflow</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fno-strict-overflow</span></samp> for
integers.  With <samp><span class="option">-fwrapv</span></samp> certain types of overflow are
permitted.  For example, if the compiler gets an overflow when doing
arithmetic on constants, the overflowed value can still be used with
<samp><span class="option">-fwrapv</span></samp>, but not otherwise.

more memory (in general).  There are some compatibility issues
with <em>unit-at-a-time</em> mode:
          <ul>
<li>enabling <em>unit-at-a-time</em> mode may change the order
in which functions, variables, and top-level <code>asm</code> statements
are emitted, and will likely break code relying on some particular
ordering.  The majority of such top-level <code>asm</code> statements,
though, can be replaced by <code>section</code> attributes.  The

used in the input file, at the cost of some optimizations.

          <li><em>unit-at-a-time</em> mode removes unreferenced static variables
and functions.  This may result in undefined references
when an <code>asm</code> statement refers directly to variables or functions
that are otherwise unused.  In that case either the variable/function
shall be listed as an operand of the <code>asm</code> statement operand or,
in the case of top-level <code>asm</code> statements the attribute <code>used</code>

Allow re-association of operands in series of floating-point operations. 
This violates the ISO C and C++ language standard by possibly changing

distinct +0.0 and &minus;0.0 values, which then prohibits simplification
of expressions such as x+0.0 or 0.0*x (even with <samp><span class="option">-ffinite-math-only</span></samp>). 
This option implies that the sign of a zero result isn't significant.

     <br><dt><code>-frounding-math</code><dd><a name="index-frounding_002dmath-747"></a>Disable transformations and optimizations that assume default floating
point rounding behavior.  This is round-to-zero for all floating point
to integer conversions, and round-to-nearest for all other arithmetic
truncations.  This option should be specified for programs that change
the FP rounding mode dynamically, or that may be executed with a
non-default rounding mode.  This option disables constant folding of
floating point expressions at compile-time (which may be affected by
rounding mode) and arithmetic transformations that are unsafe in the
presence of sign-dependent rounding modes.

     <p>The default is <samp><span class="option">-fno-rounding-math</span></samp>.

     <p>This option is experimental and does not currently guarantee to
disable all GCC optimizations that are affected by rounding mode. 
Future versions of GCC may provide finer control of this setting
using C99's <code>FENV_ACCESS</code> pragma.  This command line option
will be used to specify the default state for <code>FENV_ACCESS</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-frtl-abstract-sequences</code><dd><a name="index-frtl_002dabstract_002dsequences-748"></a>It is a size optimization method. This option is to find identical
sequences of code, which can be turned into pseudo-procedures  and
then  replace  all  occurrences with  calls to  the  newly created

traps during floating-point operations.  Setting this option disables
optimizations that may change the number of exceptions visible with
signaling NaNs.  This option implies <samp><span class="option">-ftrapping-math</span></samp>.

     <p>This option causes the preprocessor macro <code>__SUPPORT_SNAN__</code> to

 <p>The following options control optimizations that may improve
performance, but are not enabled by any <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> options.  This

<dt><code>-fbranch-probabilities</code><dd><a name="index-fbranch_002dprobabilities-752"></a>After running a program compiled with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp>
(see <a href="Debugging-Options.html#Debugging-Options">Options for Debugging Your Program or <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp></a>), you can compile it a second time using
<samp><span class="option">-fbranch-probabilities</span></samp>, to improve optimizations based on
the number of times each branch was taken.  When the program
compiled with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp> exits it saves arc execution
counts to a file called <samp><var>sourcename</var><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp> for each source
file.  The information in this data file is very dependent on the
structure of the generated code, so you must use the same source code
and the same optimization options for both compilations.

     <p>With <samp><span class="option">-fbranch-probabilities</span></samp>, GCC puts a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">REG_BR_PROB</span></samp>&rsquo; note on each &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">JUMP_INSN</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">CALL_INSN</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
These can be used to improve optimization.  Currently, they are only
used in one place: in <samp><span class="file">reorg.c</span></samp>, instead of guessing which path a
branch is mostly to take, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">REG_BR_PROB</span></samp>&rsquo; values are used to
exactly determine which path is taken more often.

     <br><dt><code>-fprofile-values</code><dd><a name="index-fprofile_002dvalues-753"></a>If combined with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp>, it adds code so that some
data about values of expressions in the program is gathered.

     <p>With <samp><span class="option">-fbranch-probabilities</span></samp>, it reads back the data gathered
from profiling values of expressions and adds &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">REG_VALUE_PROFILE</span></samp>&rsquo;
notes to instructions for their later usage in optimizations.

     <p>Enabled with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-generate</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-use</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fvpt</code><dd><a name="index-fvpt-754"></a>If combined with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp>, it instructs the compiler to add
a code to gather information about values of expressions.

     <p>With <samp><span class="option">-fbranch-probabilities</span></samp>, it reads back the data gathered
and actually performs the optimizations based on them. 
Currently the optimizations include specialization of division operation
using the knowledge about the value of the denominator.

     <br><dt><code>-frename-registers</code><dd><a name="index-frename_002dregisters-755"></a>Attempt to avoid false dependencies in scheduled code by making use
of registers left over after register allocation.  This optimization
will most benefit processors with lots of registers.  Depending on the
debug information format adopted by the target, however, it can
make debugging impossible, since variables will no longer stay in
a &ldquo;home register&rdquo;.

     <p>Enabled by default with <samp><span class="option">-funroll-loops</span></samp>.

It also turns on complete loop peeling (i.e. complete removal of loops with
small constant number of iterations).  This option makes code larger, and may
or may not make it run faster.

     <p>Enabled with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-use</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-funroll-all-loops</code><dd><a name="index-funroll_002dall_002dloops-758"></a>Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when
the loop is entered.  This usually makes programs run more slowly. 
<samp><span class="option">-funroll-all-loops</span></samp> implies the same options as

     <br><dt><code>-fpeel-loops</code><dd><a name="index-fpeel_002dloops-759"></a>Peels the loops for that there is enough information that they do not
roll much (from profile feedback).  It also turns on complete loop peeling
(i.e. complete removal of loops with small constant number of iterations).

function or the name of the data item determines the section's name
in the output file.

     <p>Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations
to improve locality of reference in the instruction space.  Most systems
using the ELF object format and SPARC processors running Solaris 2 have
linkers with such optimizations.  AIX may have these optimizations in
the future.

     <p>Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing
so.  When you specify these options, the assembler and linker will
create larger object and executable files and will also be slower. 
You will not be able to use <code>gprof</code> on all systems if you
specify this option and you may have problems with debugging if
you specify both this option and <samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp>.

threading. 
The use of target registers can typically be exposed only during reload,
thus hoisting loads out of loops and doing inter-block scheduling needs
a separate optimization pass.

     <br><dt><code>-fbranch-target-load-optimize2</code><dd><a name="index-fbranch_002dtarget_002dload_002doptimize2-765"></a>Perform branch target register load optimization after prologue / epilogue

     <br><dt><code>-fbtr-bb-exclusive</code><dd><a name="index-fbtr_002dbb_002dexclusive-766"></a>When performing branch target register load optimization, don't reuse
branch target registers in within any basic block.

     <br><dt><code>-fstack-protector</code><dd><a name="index-fstack_002dprotector-767"></a>Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack smashing
attacks.  This is done by adding a guard variable to functions with
vulnerable objects.  This includes functions that call alloca, and
functions with buffers larger than 8 bytes.  The guards are initialized
when a function is entered and then checked when the function exits. 
If a guard check fails, an error message is printed and the program exits.

     <br><dt><code>-fstack-protector-all</code><dd><a name="index-fstack_002dprotector_002dall-768"></a>Like <samp><span class="option">-fstack-protector</span></samp> except that all functions are protected.

     <br><dt><code>-fsection-anchors</code><dd><a name="index-fsection_002danchors-769"></a>Try to reduce the number of symbolic address calculations by using
shared &ldquo;anchor&rdquo; symbols to address nearby objects.  This transformation
can help to reduce the number of GOT entries and GOT accesses on some
targets.

     <p>For example, the implementation of the following function <code>foo</code>:

     <pre class="smallexample">          static int a, b, c;
          int foo (void) { return a + b + c; }
</pre>
     <p>would usually calculate the addresses of all three variables, but if you
compile it with <samp><span class="option">-fsection-anchors</span></samp>, it will access the variables
from a common anchor point instead.  The effect is similar to the
following pseudocode (which isn't valid C):

     <pre class="smallexample">          int foo (void)
          {
            register int *xr = &amp;x;
            return xr[&amp;a - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;b - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;c - &amp;x];
          }
</pre>
     <p>Not all targets support this option.

     <br><dt><code>-fremove-local-statics</code><dd><a name="index-fremove_002dlocal_002dstatics-770"></a>Converts function-local static variables to automatic variables when it
is safe to do so.  This transformation can reduce the number of
instructions executed due to automatic variables being cheaper to
read/write than static variables.

     <br><dt><code>-fpromote-loop-indices</code><dd><a name="index-fpromote_002dloop_002dindices-771"></a>Converts loop indices that have a type shorter than the word size to
word-sized quantities.  This transformation can reduce the overhead
associated with sign/zero-extension and truncation of such variables. 
Using <samp><span class="option">-funsafe-loop-optimizations</span></samp> with this option may result
in more effective optimization.

     <br><dt><code>--param </code><var>name</var><code>=</code><var>value</var><dd><a name="index-param-772"></a>In some places, GCC uses various constants to control the amount of
optimization that is done.  For example, GCC will not inline functions
that contain more that a certain number of instructions.  You can
control some of these constants on the command-line using the
<samp><span class="option">--param</span></samp> option.

     <p>The names of specific parameters, and the meaning of the values, are
tied to the internals of the compiler, and are subject to change
without notice in future releases.

     <p>In each case, the <var>value</var> is an integer.  The allowable choices for
<var>name</var> are given in the following table:

          <dl>
<dt><code>salias-max-implicit-fields</code><dd>The maximum number of fields in a variable without direct
structure accesses for which structure aliasing will consider trying
to track each field.  The default is 5

          <br><dt><code>salias-max-array-elements</code><dd>The maximum number of elements an array can have and its elements
still be tracked individually by structure aliasing. The default is 4

          <br><dt><code>sra-max-structure-size</code><dd>The maximum structure size, in bytes, at which the scalar replacement
of aggregates (SRA) optimization will perform block copies.  The
default value, 0, implies that GCC will select the most appropriate
size itself.

          <br><dt><code>sra-field-structure-ratio</code><dd>The threshold ratio (as a percentage) between instantiated fields and
the complete structure size.  We say that if the ratio of the number
of bytes in instantiated fields to the number of bytes in the complete
structure exceeds this parameter, then block copies are not used.  The
default is 75.

          <br><dt><code>struct-reorg-cold-struct-ratio</code><dd>The threshold ratio (as a percentage) between a structure frequency
and the frequency of the hottest structure in the program.  This parameter
is used by struct-reorg optimization enabled by <samp><span class="option">-fipa-struct-reorg</span></samp>. 
We say that if the ratio of a structure frequency, calculated by profiling,
to the hottest structure frequency in the program is less than this
parameter, then structure reorganization is not applied to this structure. 
The default is 10.

          <br><dt><code>max-crossjump-edges</code><dd>The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for crossjumping. 
The algorithm used by <samp><span class="option">-fcrossjumping</span></samp> is O(N^2) in
the number of edges incoming to each block.  Increasing values mean
more aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase with
probably small improvement in executable size.

          <br><dt><code>min-crossjump-insns</code><dd>The minimum number of instructions which must be matched at the end
of two blocks before crossjumping will be performed on them.  This
value is ignored in the case where all instructions in the block being
crossjumped from are matched.  The default value is 5.

          <br><dt><code>max-grow-copy-bb-insns</code><dd>The maximum code size expansion factor when copying basic blocks
instead of jumping.  The expansion is relative to a jump instruction. 
The default value is 8.

          <br><dt><code>max-goto-duplication-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions to duplicate to a block that jumps
to a computed goto.  To avoid O(N^2) behavior in a number of
passes, GCC factors computed gotos early in the compilation process,
and unfactors them as late as possible.  Only computed jumps at the
end of a basic blocks with no more than max-goto-duplication-insns are
unfactored.  The default value is 8.

          <br><dt><code>max-delay-slot-insn-search</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking for an
instruction to fill a delay slot.  If more than this arbitrary number of
instructions is searched, the time savings from filling the delay slot
will be minimal so stop searching.  Increasing values mean more
aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase with probably
small improvement in executable run time.

          <br><dt><code>max-delay-slot-live-search</code><dd>When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of instructions to
consider when searching for a block with valid live register
information.  Increasing this arbitrarily chosen value means more
aggressive optimization, increasing the compile time.  This parameter
should be removed when the delay slot code is rewritten to maintain the
control-flow graph.

          <br><dt><code>max-gcse-memory</code><dd>The approximate maximum amount of memory that will be allocated in
order to perform the global common subexpression elimination
optimization.  If more memory than specified is required, the
optimization will not be done.

          <br><dt><code>max-gcse-passes</code><dd>The maximum number of passes of GCSE to run.  The default is 1.

          <br><dt><code>max-pending-list-length</code><dd>The maximum number of pending dependencies scheduling will allow
before flushing the current state and starting over.  Large functions
with few branches or calls can create excessively large lists which
needlessly consume memory and resources.

          <br><dt><code>max-inline-insns-single</code><dd>Several parameters control the tree inliner used in gcc. 
This number sets the maximum number of instructions (counted in GCC's
internal representation) in a single function that the tree inliner
will consider for inlining.  This only affects functions declared
inline and methods implemented in a class declaration (C++). 
The default value is 450.

          <br><dt><code>max-inline-insns-auto</code><dd>When you use <samp><span class="option">-finline-functions</span></samp> (included in <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>),
a lot of functions that would otherwise not be considered for inlining
by the compiler will be investigated.  To those functions, a different
(more restrictive) limit compared to functions declared inline can
be applied. 
The default value is 90.

          <br><dt><code>large-function-insns</code><dd>The limit specifying really large functions.  For functions larger than this
limit after inlining inlining is constrained by
<samp><span class="option">--param large-function-growth</span></samp>.  This parameter is useful primarily
to avoid extreme compilation time caused by non-linear algorithms used by the
backend. 
This parameter is ignored when <samp><span class="option">-funit-at-a-time</span></samp> is not used. 
The default value is 2700.

          <br><dt><code>large-function-growth</code><dd>Specifies maximal growth of large function caused by inlining in percents. 
This parameter is ignored when <samp><span class="option">-funit-at-a-time</span></samp> is not used. 
The default value is 100 which limits large function growth to 2.0 times
the original size.

          <br><dt><code>large-unit-insns</code><dd>The limit specifying large translation unit.  Growth caused by inlining of
units larger than this limit is limited by <samp><span class="option">--param inline-unit-growth</span></samp>. 
For small units this might be too tight (consider unit consisting of function A
that is inline and B that just calls A three time.  If B is small relative to
A, the growth of unit is 300\% and yet such inlining is very sane.  For very
large units consisting of small inlineable functions however the overall unit
growth limit is needed to avoid exponential explosion of code size.  Thus for
smaller units, the size is increased to <samp><span class="option">--param large-unit-insns</span></samp>
before applying <samp><span class="option">--param inline-unit-growth</span></samp>.  The default is 10000

          <br><dt><code>inline-unit-growth</code><dd>Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by inlining. 
This parameter is ignored when <samp><span class="option">-funit-at-a-time</span></samp> is not used. 
The default value is 30 which limits unit growth to 1.3 times the original
size.

          <br><dt><code>large-stack-frame</code><dd>The limit specifying large stack frames.  While inlining the algorithm is trying
to not grow past this limit too much.  Default value is 256 bytes.

          <br><dt><code>large-stack-frame-growth</code><dd>Specifies maximal growth of large stack frames caused by inlining in percents. 
The default value is 1000 which limits large stack frame growth to 11 times
the original size.

          <br><dt><code>max-inline-insns-recursive</code><dt><code>max-inline-insns-recursive-auto</code><dd>Specifies maximum number of instructions out-of-line copy of self recursive inline
function can grow into by performing recursive inlining.

          <p>For functions declared inline <samp><span class="option">--param max-inline-insns-recursive</span></samp> is
taken into account.  For function not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when <samp><span class="option">-finline-functions</span></samp> (included in <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>) is
enabled and <samp><span class="option">--param max-inline-insns-recursive-auto</span></samp> is used.  The
default value is 450.

          <br><dt><code>max-inline-recursive-depth</code><dt><code>max-inline-recursive-depth-auto</code><dd>Specifies maximum recursion depth used by the recursive inlining.

          <p>For functions declared inline <samp><span class="option">--param max-inline-recursive-depth</span></samp> is
taken into account.  For function not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when <samp><span class="option">-finline-functions</span></samp> (included in <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>) is
enabled and <samp><span class="option">--param max-inline-recursive-depth-auto</span></samp> is used.  The
default value is 8.

          <br><dt><code>min-inline-recursive-probability</code><dd>Recursive inlining is profitable only for function having deep recursion
in average and can hurt for function having little recursion depth by
increasing the prologue size or complexity of function body to other
optimizers.

          <p>When profile feedback is available (see <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-generate</span></samp>) the actual
recursion depth can be guessed from probability that function will recurse via
given call expression.  This parameter limits inlining only to call expression
whose probability exceeds given threshold (in percents).  The default value is
10.

          <br><dt><code>inline-call-cost</code><dd>Specify cost of call instruction relative to simple arithmetics operations
(having cost of 1).  Increasing this cost disqualifies inlining of non-leaf
functions and at the same time increases size of leaf function that is believed to
reduce function size by being inlined.  In effect it increases amount of
inlining for code having large abstraction penalty (many functions that just
pass the arguments to other functions) and decrease inlining for code with low
abstraction penalty.  The default value is 12.

          <br><dt><code>min-vect-loop-bound</code><dd>The minimum number of iterations under which a loop will not get vectorized
when <samp><span class="option">-ftree-vectorize</span></samp> is used.  The number of iterations after
vectorization needs to be greater than the value specified by this option
to allow vectorization.  The default value is 0.

          <br><dt><code>max-unrolled-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions that a loop should have if that loop
is unrolled, and if the loop is unrolled, it determines how many times
the loop code is unrolled.

          <br><dt><code>max-average-unrolled-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions biased by probabilities of their execution
that a loop should have if that loop is unrolled, and if the loop is unrolled,
it determines how many times the loop code is unrolled.

          <br><dt><code>max-unroll-times</code><dd>The maximum number of unrollings of a single loop.

          <br><dt><code>max-peeled-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions that a loop should have if that loop
is peeled, and if the loop is peeled, it determines how many times
the loop code is peeled.

          <br><dt><code>max-peel-times</code><dd>The maximum number of peelings of a single loop.

          <br><dt><code>max-completely-peeled-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of insns of a completely peeled loop.

          <br><dt><code>max-completely-peel-times</code><dd>The maximum number of iterations of a loop to be suitable for complete peeling.

          <br><dt><code>max-unswitch-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of insns of an unswitched loop.

          <br><dt><code>max-unswitch-level</code><dd>The maximum number of branches unswitched in a single loop.

          <br><dt><code>lim-expensive</code><dd>The minimum cost of an expensive expression in the loop invariant motion.

          <br><dt><code>iv-consider-all-candidates-bound</code><dd>Bound on number of candidates for induction variables below that
all candidates are considered for each use in induction variable
optimizations.  Only the most relevant candidates are considered
if there are more candidates, to avoid quadratic time complexity.

          <br><dt><code>iv-max-considered-uses</code><dd>The induction variable optimizations give up on loops that contain more
induction variable uses.

          <br><dt><code>iv-always-prune-cand-set-bound</code><dd>If number of candidates in the set is smaller than this value,
we always try to remove unnecessary ivs from the set during its
optimization when a new iv is added to the set.

          <br><dt><code>scev-max-expr-size</code><dd>Bound on size of expressions used in the scalar evolutions analyzer. 
Large expressions slow the analyzer.

          <br><dt><code>omega-max-vars</code><dd>The maximum number of variables in an Omega constraint system. 
The default value is 128.

          <br><dt><code>omega-max-geqs</code><dd>The maximum number of inequalities in an Omega constraint system. 
The default value is 256.

          <br><dt><code>omega-max-eqs</code><dd>The maximum number of equalities in an Omega constraint system. 
The default value is 128.

          <br><dt><code>omega-max-wild-cards</code><dd>The maximum number of wildcard variables that the Omega solver will
be able to insert.  The default value is 18.

          <br><dt><code>omega-hash-table-size</code><dd>The size of the hash table in the Omega solver.  The default value is
550.

          <br><dt><code>omega-max-keys</code><dd>The maximal number of keys used by the Omega solver.  The default
value is 500.

          <br><dt><code>omega-eliminate-redundant-constraints</code><dd>When set to 1, use expensive methods to eliminate all redundant
constraints.  The default value is 0.

          <br><dt><code>vect-max-version-for-alignment-checks</code><dd>The maximum number of runtime checks that can be performed when
doing loop versioning for alignment in the vectorizer.  See option
ftree-vect-loop-version for more information.

          <br><dt><code>vect-max-version-for-alias-checks</code><dd>The maximum number of runtime checks that can be performed when
doing loop versioning for alias in the vectorizer.  See option
ftree-vect-loop-version for more information.

          <br><dt><code>max-iterations-to-track</code><dd>
The maximum number of iterations of a loop the brute force algorithm
for analysis of # of iterations of the loop tries to evaluate.

          <br><dt><code>hot-bb-count-fraction</code><dd>Select fraction of the maximal count of repetitions of basic block in program
given basic block needs to have to be considered hot.

          <br><dt><code>hot-bb-frequency-fraction</code><dd>Select fraction of the maximal frequency of executions of basic block in
function given basic block needs to have to be considered hot

          <br><dt><code>max-predicted-iterations</code><dd>The maximum number of loop iterations we predict statically.  This is useful
in cases where function contain single loop with known bound and other loop
with unknown.  We predict the known number of iterations correctly, while
the unknown number of iterations average to roughly 10.  This means that the
loop without bounds would appear artificially cold relative to the other one.

          <br><dt><code>align-threshold</code><dd>
Select fraction of the maximal frequency of executions of basic block in
function given basic block will get aligned.

          <br><dt><code>align-loop-iterations</code><dd>
A loop expected to iterate at lest the selected number of iterations will get
aligned.

          <br><dt><code>tracer-dynamic-coverage</code><dt><code>tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback</code><dd>
This value is used to limit superblock formation once the given percentage of
executed instructions is covered.  This limits unnecessary code size
expansion.

          <p>The <samp><span class="option">tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback</span></samp> is used only when profile
feedback is available.  The real profiles (as opposed to statically estimated
ones) are much less balanced allowing the threshold to be larger value.

          <br><dt><code>tracer-max-code-growth</code><dd>Stop tail duplication once code growth has reached given percentage.  This is
rather hokey argument, as most of the duplicates will be eliminated later in
cross jumping, so it may be set to much higher values than is the desired code
growth.

          <br><dt><code>tracer-min-branch-ratio</code><dd>
Stop reverse growth when the reverse probability of best edge is less than this
threshold (in percent).

          <br><dt><code>tracer-min-branch-ratio</code><dt><code>tracer-min-branch-ratio-feedback</code><dd>
Stop forward growth if the best edge do have probability lower than this
threshold.

          <p>Similarly to <samp><span class="option">tracer-dynamic-coverage</span></samp> two values are present, one for
compilation for profile feedback and one for compilation without.  The value
for compilation with profile feedback needs to be more conservative (higher) in
order to make tracer effective.

          <br><dt><code>max-cse-path-length</code><dd>
Maximum number of basic blocks on path that cse considers.  The default is 10.

          <br><dt><code>max-cse-insns</code><dd>The maximum instructions CSE process before flushing. The default is 1000.

          <br><dt><code>max-aliased-vops</code><dd>
Maximum number of virtual operands per function allowed to represent
aliases before triggering the alias partitioning heuristic.  Alias
partitioning reduces compile times and memory consumption needed for
aliasing at the expense of precision loss in alias information.  The
default value for this parameter is 100 for -O1, 500 for -O2 and 1000
for -O3.

          <p>Notice that if a function contains more memory statements than the
value of this parameter, it is not really possible to achieve this
reduction.  In this case, the compiler will use the number of memory
statements as the value for <samp><span class="option">max-aliased-vops</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>avg-aliased-vops</code><dd>
Average number of virtual operands per statement allowed to represent
aliases before triggering the alias partitioning heuristic.  This
works in conjunction with <samp><span class="option">max-aliased-vops</span></samp>.  If a function
contains more than <samp><span class="option">max-aliased-vops</span></samp> virtual operators, then
memory symbols will be grouped into memory partitions until either the
total number of virtual operators is below <samp><span class="option">max-aliased-vops</span></samp>
or the average number of virtual operators per memory statement is
below <samp><span class="option">avg-aliased-vops</span></samp>.  The default value for this parameter
is 1 for -O1 and -O2, and 3 for -O3.

          <br><dt><code>ggc-min-expand</code><dd>
GCC uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory allocation.  This
parameter specifies the minimum percentage by which the garbage
collector's heap should be allowed to expand between collections. 
Tuning this may improve compilation speed; it has no effect on code
generation.

          <p>The default is 30% + 70% * (RAM/1GB) with an upper bound of 100% when
RAM &gt;= 1GB.  If <code>getrlimit</code> is available, the notion of "RAM" is
the smallest of actual RAM and <code>RLIMIT_DATA</code> or <code>RLIMIT_AS</code>.  If
GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a particular platform, the lower
bound of 30% is used.  Setting this parameter and
<samp><span class="option">ggc-min-heapsize</span></samp> to zero causes a full collection to occur at
every opportunity.  This is extremely slow, but can be useful for
debugging.

          <br><dt><code>ggc-min-heapsize</code><dd>
Minimum size of the garbage collector's heap before it begins bothering
to collect garbage.  The first collection occurs after the heap expands
by <samp><span class="option">ggc-min-expand</span></samp>% beyond <samp><span class="option">ggc-min-heapsize</span></samp>.  Again,
tuning this may improve compilation speed, and has no effect on code
generation.

          <p>The default is the smaller of RAM/8, RLIMIT_RSS, or a limit which
tries to ensure that RLIMIT_DATA or RLIMIT_AS are not exceeded, but
with a lower bound of 4096 (four megabytes) and an upper bound of
131072 (128 megabytes).  If GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a
particular platform, the lower bound is used.  Setting this parameter
very large effectively disables garbage collection.  Setting this
parameter and <samp><span class="option">ggc-min-expand</span></samp> to zero causes a full collection
to occur at every opportunity.

          <br><dt><code>max-reload-search-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instruction reload should look backward for equivalent
register.  Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making the
compile time increase with probably slightly better performance.  The default
value is 100.

          <br><dt><code>max-cselib-memory-locations</code><dd>The maximum number of memory locations cselib should take into account. 
Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making the compile time
increase with probably slightly better performance.  The default value is 500.

          <br><dt><code>max-flow-memory-locations</code><dd>Similar as <samp><span class="option">max-cselib-memory-locations</span></samp> but for dataflow liveness. 
The default value is 100.

          <br><dt><code>reorder-blocks-duplicate</code><dt><code>reorder-blocks-duplicate-feedback</code><dd>
Used by basic block reordering pass to decide whether to use unconditional
branch or duplicate the code on its destination.  Code is duplicated when its
estimated size is smaller than this value multiplied by the estimated size of
unconditional jump in the hot spots of the program.

          <p>The <samp><span class="option">reorder-block-duplicate-feedback</span></samp> is used only when profile
feedback is available and may be set to higher values than
<samp><span class="option">reorder-block-duplicate</span></samp> since information about the hot spots is more
accurate.

          <br><dt><code>max-sched-ready-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions ready to be issued the scheduler should
consider at any given time during the first scheduling pass.  Increasing
values mean more thorough searches, making the compilation time increase
with probably little benefit.  The default value is 100.

          <br><dt><code>max-sched-region-blocks</code><dd>The maximum number of blocks in a region to be considered for
interblock scheduling.  The default value is 10.

          <br><dt><code>max-sched-region-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of insns in a region to be considered for
interblock scheduling.  The default value is 100.

          <br><dt><code>min-spec-prob</code><dd>The minimum probability (in percents) of reaching a source block
for interblock speculative scheduling.  The default value is 40.

          <br><dt><code>max-sched-extend-regions-iters</code><dd>The maximum number of iterations through CFG to extend regions. 
0 - disable region extension,
N - do at most N iterations. 
The default value is 0.

          <br><dt><code>max-sched-insn-conflict-delay</code><dd>The maximum conflict delay for an insn to be considered for speculative motion. 
The default value is 3.

          <br><dt><code>sched-spec-prob-cutoff</code><dd>The minimal probability of speculation success (in percents), so that
speculative insn will be scheduled. 
The default value is 40.

          <br><dt><code>max-last-value-rtl</code><dd>
The maximum size measured as number of RTLs that can be recorded in an expression
in combiner for a pseudo register as last known value of that register.  The default
is 10000.

          <br><dt><code>integer-share-limit</code><dd>Small integer constants can use a shared data structure, reducing the
compiler's memory usage and increasing its speed.  This sets the maximum
value of a shared integer constant.  The default value is 256.

          <br><dt><code>min-virtual-mappings</code><dd>Specifies the minimum number of virtual mappings in the incremental
SSA updater that should be registered to trigger the virtual mappings
heuristic defined by virtual-mappings-ratio.  The default value is
100.

          <br><dt><code>virtual-mappings-ratio</code><dd>If the number of virtual mappings is virtual-mappings-ratio bigger
than the number of virtual symbols to be updated, then the incremental
SSA updater switches to a full update for those symbols.  The default
ratio is 3.

          <br><dt><code>ssp-buffer-size</code><dd>The minimum size of buffers (i.e. arrays) that will receive stack smashing
protection when <samp><span class="option">-fstack-protection</span></samp> is used.

          <br><dt><code>max-jump-thread-duplication-stmts</code><dd>Maximum number of statements allowed in a block that needs to be
duplicated when threading jumps.

          <br><dt><code>max-fields-for-field-sensitive</code><dd>Maximum number of fields in a structure we will treat in
a field sensitive manner during pointer analysis.  The default is zero
for -O0, and -O1 and 100 for -Os, -O2, and -O3.

          <br><dt><code>prefetch-latency</code><dd>Estimate on average number of instructions that are executed before
prefetch finishes.  The distance we prefetch ahead is proportional
to this constant.  Increasing this number may also lead to less
streams being prefetched (see <samp><span class="option">simultaneous-prefetches</span></samp>).

          <br><dt><code>simultaneous-prefetches</code><dd>Maximum number of prefetches that can run at the same time.

          <br><dt><code>l1-cache-line-size</code><dd>The size of cache line in L1 cache, in bytes.

          <br><dt><code>l1-cache-size</code><dd>The size of L1 cache, in kilobytes.

          <br><dt><code>l2-cache-size</code><dd>The size of L2 cache, in kilobytes.

          <br><dt><code>use-canonical-types</code><dd>Whether the compiler should use the &ldquo;canonical&rdquo; type system.  By
default, this should always be 1, which uses a more efficient internal
mechanism for comparing types in C++ and Objective-C++.  However, if
bugs in the canonical type system are causing compilation failures,
set this value to 0 to disable canonical types.

          <br><dt><code>max-partial-antic-length</code><dd>Maximum length of the partial antic set computed during the tree
partial redundancy elimination optimization (<samp><span class="option">-ftree-pre</span></samp>) when
optimizing at <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp> and above.  For some sorts of source code
the enhanced partial redundancy elimination optimization can run away,
consuming all of the memory available on the host machine.  This
parameter sets a limit on the length of the sets that are computed,
which prevents the runaway behaviour.  Setting a value of 0 for
this paramter will allow an unlimited set length.

          <br><dt><code>sccvn-max-scc-size</code><dd>Maximum size of a strongly connected component (SCC) during SCCVN
processing.  If this limit is hit, SCCVN processing for the whole
function will not be done and optimizations depending on it will
be disabled.  The default maximum SCC size is 10000.
