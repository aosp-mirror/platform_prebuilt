<h3 class="section">20.3 Source Files Containing Type Information</h3>

<p><a name="index-generated-files-4402"></a><a name="index-files_002c-generated-4403"></a>
Whenever you add <code>GTY</code> markers to a source file that previously
had none, or create a new source file containing <code>GTY</code> markers,
there are three things you need to do:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>You need to add the file to the list of source files the type
machinery scans.  There are four cases:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>For a back-end file, this is usually done
automatically; if not, you should add it to <code>target_gtfiles</code> in
the appropriate port's entries in <samp><span class="file">config.gcc</span></samp>.

          <li>For files shared by all front ends, add the filename to the
<code>GTFILES</code> variable in <samp><span class="file">Makefile.in</span></samp>.

          <li>For files that are part of one front end, add the filename to the
<code>gtfiles</code> variable defined in the appropriate
<samp><span class="file">config-lang.in</span></samp>.  For C, the file is <samp><span class="file">c-config-lang.in</span></samp>.

          <li>For files that are part of some but not all front ends, add the
filename to the <code>gtfiles</code> variable of <em>all</em> the front ends
that use it.
          </ol>

     <li>If the file was a header file, you'll need to check that it's included
in the right place to be visible to the generated files.  For a back-end
header file, this should be done automatically.  For a front-end header
file, it needs to be included by the same file that includes
<samp><span class="file">gtype-</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.h</span></samp>.  For other header files, it needs to be
included in <samp><span class="file">gtype-desc.c</span></samp>, which is a generated file, so add it to
<code>ifiles</code> in <code>open_base_file</code> in <samp><span class="file">gengtype.c</span></samp>.

     <p>For source files that aren't header files, the machinery will generate a
header file that should be included in the source file you just changed. 
The file will be called <samp><span class="file">gt-</span><var>path</var><span class="file">.h</span></samp> where <var>path</var> is the
pathname relative to the <samp><span class="file">gcc</span></samp> directory with slashes replaced by
<tt>-</tt>, so for example the header file to be included in
<samp><span class="file">cp/parser.c</span></samp> is called <samp><span class="file">gt-cp-parser.c</span></samp>.  The
generated header file should be included after everything else in the
source file.  Don't forget to mention this file as a dependency in the
<samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>!

      </ol>

 <p>For language frontends, there is another file that needs to be included
somewhere.  It will be called <samp><span class="file">gtype-</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.h</span></samp>, where
<var>lang</var> is the name of the subdirectory the language is contained in.
