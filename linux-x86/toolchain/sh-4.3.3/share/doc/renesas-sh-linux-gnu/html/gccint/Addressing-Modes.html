memory address.  Note that it is up to you to specify a value equal to
the maximum number that <code>GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS</code> would ever
accept.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS</b> (<var>mode, x, label</var>)<var><a name="index-GO_005fIF_005fLEGITIMATE_005fADDRESS-3810"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A C compound statement with a conditional <code>goto </code><var>label</var><code>;</code>
executed if <var>x</var> (an RTX) is a legitimate memory address on the
target machine for a memory operand of mode <var>mode</var>.

      <p>It usually pays to define several simpler macros to serve as
subroutines for this one.  Otherwise it may be too complicated to
understand.

      <p>This macro must exist in two variants: a strict variant and a
non-strict one.  The strict variant is used in the reload pass.  It
must be defined so that any pseudo-register that has not been
allocated a hard register is considered a memory reference.  In
contexts where some kind of register is required, a pseudo-register
with no hard register must be rejected.

      <p>The non-strict variant is used in other passes.  It must be defined to
accept all pseudo-registers in every context where some kind of
register is required.

      <p><a name="index-REG_005fOK_005fSTRICT-3811"></a>Compiler source files that want to use the strict variant of this
macro define the macro <code>REG_OK_STRICT</code>.  You should use an
<code>#ifdef REG_OK_STRICT</code> conditional to define the strict variant
in that case and the non-strict variant otherwise.

      <p>Subroutines to check for acceptable registers for various purposes (one
for base registers, one for index registers, and so on) are typically
among the subroutines used to define <code>GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS</code>. 
Then only these subroutine macros need have two variants; the higher
levels of macros may be the same whether strict or not.

      <p>Normally, constant addresses which are the sum of a <code>symbol_ref</code>
and an integer are stored inside a <code>const</code> RTX to mark them as
constant.  Therefore, there is no need to recognize such sums
specifically as legitimate addresses.  Normally you would simply
recognize any <code>const</code> as legitimate.

      <p>Usually <code>PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS</code> is not prepared to handle constant
sums that are not marked with  <code>const</code>.  It assumes that a naked
<code>plus</code> indicates indexing.  If so, then you <em>must</em> reject such
naked constant sums as illegitimate addresses, so that none of them will
be given to <code>PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS</code>.

      <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bTARGET_005fENCODE_005fSECTION_005fINFO_007d-and-address-validation-3812"></a>On some machines, whether a symbolic address is legitimate depends on
the section that the address refers to.  On these machines, define the
target hook <code>TARGET_ENCODE_SECTION_INFO</code> to store the information
into the <code>symbol_ref</code>, and then check for it here.  When you see a
<code>const</code>, you will have to look inside it to find the
<code>symbol_ref</code> in order to determine the section.  See <a href="Assembler-Format.html#Assembler-Format">Assembler Format</a>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>FIND_BASE_TERM</b> (<var>x</var>)<var><a name="index-FIND_005fBASE_005fTERM-3813"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A C expression to determine the base term of address <var>x</var>. 
This macro is used in only one place: `find_base_term' in alias.c.

      <p>It is always safe for this macro to not be defined.  It exists so
that alias analysis can understand machine-dependent addresses.

      <p>The typical use of this macro is to handle addresses containing
a label_ref or symbol_ref within an UNSPEC. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>LEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS</b> (<var>x, oldx, mode, win</var>)<var><a name="index-LEGITIMIZE_005fADDRESS-3814"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A C compound statement that attempts to replace <var>x</var> with a valid
memory address for an operand of mode <var>mode</var>.  <var>win</var> will be a
C statement label elsewhere in the code; the macro definition may use

     <pre class="smallexample">          GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS (<var>mode</var>, <var>x</var>, <var>win</var>);
</pre>
      <p class="noindent">to avoid further processing if the address has become legitimate.

      <p><a name="index-break_005fout_005fmemory_005frefs-3815"></a><var>x</var> will always be the result of a call to <code>break_out_memory_refs</code>,
and <var>oldx</var> will be the operand that was given to that function to produce
<var>x</var>.

      <p>The code generated by this macro should not alter the substructure of
<var>x</var>.  If it transforms <var>x</var> into a more legitimate form, it
should assign <var>x</var> (which will always be a C variable) a new value.

      <p>It is not necessary for this macro to come up with a legitimate
address.  The compiler has standard ways of doing so in all cases.  In
fact, it is safe to omit this macro.  But often a
machine-dependent strategy can generate better code. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>LEGITIMIZE_RELOAD_ADDRESS</b> (<var>x, mode, opnum, type, ind_levels, win</var>)<var><a name="index-LEGITIMIZE_005fRELOAD_005fADDRESS-3816"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A C compound statement that attempts to replace <var>x</var>, which is an address
that needs reloading, with a valid memory address for an operand of mode
<var>mode</var>.  <var>win</var> will be a C statement label elsewhere in the code. 
It is not necessary to define this macro, but it might be useful for
performance reasons.

      <p>For example, on the i386, it is sometimes possible to use a single
reload register instead of two by reloading a sum of two pseudo
registers into a register.  On the other hand, for number of RISC
processors offsets are limited so that often an intermediate address
needs to be generated in order to address a stack slot.  By defining
<code>LEGITIMIZE_RELOAD_ADDRESS</code> appropriately, the intermediate addresses
generated for adjacent some stack slots can be made identical, and thus
be shared.

      <p><em>Note</em>: This macro should be used with caution.  It is necessary
to know something of how reload works in order to effectively use this,
and it is quite easy to produce macros that build in too much knowledge
of reload internals.

      <p><em>Note</em>: This macro must be able to reload an address created by a
previous invocation of this macro.  If it fails to handle such addresses
then the compiler may generate incorrect code or abort.

      <p><a name="index-push_005freload-3817"></a>The macro definition should use <code>push_reload</code> to indicate parts that
need reloading; <var>opnum</var>, <var>type</var> and <var>ind_levels</var> are usually
suitable to be passed unaltered to <code>push_reload</code>.

      <p>The code generated by this macro must not alter the substructure of
<var>x</var>.  If it transforms <var>x</var> into a more legitimate form, it
should assign <var>x</var> (which will always be a C variable) a new value. 
This also applies to parts that you change indirectly by calling
<code>push_reload</code>.

      <p><a name="index-strict_005fmemory_005faddress_005fp-3818"></a>The macro definition may use <code>strict_memory_address_p</code> to test if
the address has become legitimate.

      <p><a name="index-copy_005frtx-3819"></a>If you want to change only a part of <var>x</var>, one standard way of doing
this is to use <code>copy_rtx</code>.  Note, however, that it unshares only a
single level of rtl.  Thus, if the part to be changed is not at the
top level, you'll need to replace first the top level. 
It is not necessary for this macro to come up with a legitimate
address;  but often a machine-dependent strategy can generate better code. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>GO_IF_MODE_DEPENDENT_ADDRESS</b> (<var>addr, label</var>)<var><a name="index-GO_005fIF_005fMODE_005fDEPENDENT_005fADDRESS-3820"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A C statement or compound statement with a conditional <code>goto
</code><var>label</var><code>;</code> executed if memory address <var>x</var> (an RTX) can have
different meanings depending on the machine mode of the memory
reference it is used for or if the address is valid for some modes
but not others.

      <p>Autoincrement and autodecrement addresses typically have mode-dependent
effects because the amount of the increment or decrement is the size
of the operand being addressed.  Some machines have other mode-dependent
addresses.  Many RISC machines have no mode-dependent addresses.

      <p>You may assume that <var>addr</var> is a valid address for the machine. 
</p></blockquote></div>

&mdash; Macro: <b>LEGITIMATE_CONSTANT_P</b> (<var>x</var>)<var><a name="index-LEGITIMATE_005fCONSTANT_005fP-3821"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A C expression that is nonzero if <var>x</var> is a legitimate constant for
an immediate operand on the target machine.  You can assume that
<var>x</var> satisfies <code>CONSTANT_P</code>, so you need not check this.  In fact,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo; is a suitable definition for this macro on machines where
anything <code>CONSTANT_P</code> is valid.

<blockquote><p>This hook is used to undo the possibly obfuscating effects of the
<code>LEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS</code> and <code>LEGITIMIZE_RELOAD_ADDRESS</code> target
macros.  Some backend implementations of these macros wrap symbol
references inside an <code>UNSPEC</code> rtx to represent PIC or similar
addressing modes.  This target hook allows GCC's optimizers to understand
the semantics of these opaque <code>UNSPEC</code>s by converting them back
into their original form. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<blockquote><p>This hook should return true if <var>x</var> is of a form that cannot (or
should not) be spilled to the constant pool.  The default version of
this hook returns false.

      <p>The primary reason to define this hook is to prevent reload from
deciding that a non-legitimate constant would be better reloaded
from the constant pool instead of spilling and reloading a register
holding the constant.  This restriction is often true of addresses
of TLS symbols for various targets. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">

<blockquote><p>This hook should return true if pool entries for constant <var>x</var> can
be placed in an <code>object_block</code> structure.  <var>mode</var> is the mode
of <var>x</var>.

<blockquote><p>This hook should return the DECL of a function that implements reciprocal of
the builtin function with builtin function code <var>fn</var>, or
<code>NULL_TREE</code> if such a function is not available.  <var>tm_fn</var> is true
when <var>fn</var> is a code of a machine-dependent builtin function.  When
<var>sqrt</var> is true, additional optimizations that apply only to the reciprocal

function are valid.

<blockquote><p>This hook should return the DECL of a function <var>f</var> that given an
address <var>addr</var> as an argument returns a mask <var>m</var> that can be
used to extract from two vectors the relevant data that resides in
<var>addr</var> in case <var>addr</var> is not properly aligned.

      <p>The autovectorizer, when vectorizing a load operation from an address
<var>addr</var> that may be unaligned, will generate two vector loads from
the two aligned addresses around <var>addr</var>. It then generates a
<code>REALIGN_LOAD</code> operation to extract the relevant data from the
two loaded vectors. The first two arguments to <code>REALIGN_LOAD</code>,
<var>v1</var> and <var>v2</var>, are the two vectors, each of size <var>VS</var>, and
the third argument, <var>OFF</var>, defines how the data will be extracted
from these two vectors: if <var>OFF</var> is 0, then the returned vector is
<var>v2</var>; otherwise, the returned vector is composed from the last
<var>VS</var>-<var>OFF</var> elements of <var>v1</var> concatenated to the first
<var>OFF</var> elements of <var>v2</var>.

      <p>If this hook is defined, the autovectorizer will generate a call
to <var>f</var> (using the DECL tree that this hook returns) and will
use the return value of <var>f</var> as the argument <var>OFF</var> to
<code>REALIGN_LOAD</code>. Therefore, the mask <var>m</var> returned by <var>f</var>
should comply with the semantics expected by <code>REALIGN_LOAD</code>
described above. 
If this hook is not defined, then <var>addr</var> will be used as
the argument <var>OFF</var> to <code>REALIGN_LOAD</code>, in which case the low
log2(<var>VS</var>)-1 bits of <var>addr</var> will be considered.
