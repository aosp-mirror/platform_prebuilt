<h3 class="section">15.12 Trampolines for Nested Functions</h3>

<p><a name="index-trampolines-for-nested-functions-3762"></a><a name="index-nested-functions_002c-trampolines-for-3763"></a>
A <dfn>trampoline</dfn> is a small piece of code that is created at run time
when the address of a nested function is taken.  It normally resides on
the stack, in the stack frame of the containing function.  These macros
tell GCC how to generate code to allocate and initialize a
trampoline.

 <p>The instructions in the trampoline must do two things: load a constant
address into the static chain register, and jump to the real address of
the nested function.  On CISC machines such as the m68k, this requires
two instructions, a move immediate and a jump.  Then the two addresses
exist in the trampoline as word-long immediate operands.  On RISC
machines, it is often necessary to load each address into a register in
two parts.  Then pieces of each address form separate immediate
operands.

 <p>The code generated to initialize the trampoline must store the variable
parts&mdash;the static chain value and the function address&mdash;into the
immediate operands of the instructions.  On a CISC machine, this is
simply a matter of copying each address to a memory reference at the
proper offset from the start of the trampoline.  On a RISC machine, it
may be necessary to take out pieces of the address and store them
separately.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>TRAMPOLINE_TEMPLATE</b> (<var>file</var>)<var><a name="index-TRAMPOLINE_005fTEMPLATE-3764"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A C statement to output, on the stream <var>file</var>, assembler code for a
block of data that contains the constant parts of a trampoline.  This
code should not include a label&mdash;the label is taken care of
automatically.

      <p>If you do not define this macro, it means no template is needed
for the target.  Do not define this macro on systems where the block move
code to copy the trampoline into place would be larger than the code
to generate it on the spot. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>TRAMPOLINE_SECTION</b><var><a name="index-TRAMPOLINE_005fSECTION-3765"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return the section into which the trampoline template is to be placed
(see <a href="Sections.html#Sections">Sections</a>).  The default value is <code>readonly_data_section</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>TRAMPOLINE_SIZE</b><var><a name="index-TRAMPOLINE_005fSIZE-3766"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A C expression for the size in bytes of the trampoline, as an integer. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>TRAMPOLINE_ALIGNMENT</b><var><a name="index-TRAMPOLINE_005fALIGNMENT-3767"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Alignment required for trampolines, in bits.

      <p>If you don't define this macro, the value of <code>BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT</code>
is used for aligning trampolines. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>INITIALIZE_TRAMPOLINE</b> (<var>addr, fnaddr, static_chain</var>)<var><a name="index-INITIALIZE_005fTRAMPOLINE-3768"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A C statement to initialize the variable parts of a trampoline. 
<var>addr</var> is an RTX for the address of the trampoline; <var>fnaddr</var> is
an RTX for the address of the nested function; <var>static_chain</var> is an
RTX for the static chain value that should be passed to the function
when it is called. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>TRAMPOLINE_ADJUST_ADDRESS</b> (<var>addr</var>)<var><a name="index-TRAMPOLINE_005fADJUST_005fADDRESS-3769"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A C statement that should perform any machine-specific adjustment in
the address of the trampoline.  Its argument contains the address that
was passed to <code>INITIALIZE_TRAMPOLINE</code>.  In case the address to be
used for a function call should be different from the address in which
the template was stored, the different address should be assigned to
<var>addr</var>.  If this macro is not defined, <var>addr</var> will be used for
function calls.

      <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bTARGET_005fASM_005fFUNCTION_005fEPILOGUE_007d-and-trampolines-3770"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bTARGET_005fASM_005fFUNCTION_005fPROLOGUE_007d-and-trampolines-3771"></a>If this macro is not defined, by default the trampoline is allocated as
a stack slot.  This default is right for most machines.  The exceptions
are machines where it is impossible to execute instructions in the stack
area.  On such machines, you may have to implement a separate stack,
using this macro in conjunction with <code>TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</code>
and <code>TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</code>.

      <p><var>fp</var> points to a data structure, a <code>struct function</code>, which
describes the compilation status of the immediate containing function of
the function which the trampoline is for.  The stack slot for the
trampoline is in the stack frame of this containing function.  Other
allocation strategies probably must do something analogous with this
information. 
</p></blockquote></div>

 <p>Implementing trampolines is difficult on many machines because they have
separate instruction and data caches.  Writing into a stack location
fails to clear the memory in the instruction cache, so when the program
jumps to that location, it executes the old contents.

 <p>Here are two possible solutions.  One is to clear the relevant parts of
the instruction cache whenever a trampoline is set up.  The other is to
make all trampolines identical, by having them jump to a standard
subroutine.  The former technique makes trampoline execution faster; the
latter makes initialization faster.

 <p>To clear the instruction cache when a trampoline is initialized, define
the following macro.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>CLEAR_INSN_CACHE</b> (<var>beg, end</var>)<var><a name="index-CLEAR_005fINSN_005fCACHE-3772"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If defined, expands to a C expression clearing the <em>instruction
cache</em> in the specified interval.  The definition of this macro would
typically be a series of <code>asm</code> statements.  Both <var>beg</var> and
<var>end</var> are both pointer expressions. 
</p></blockquote></div>

 <p>The operating system may also require the stack to be made executable
before calling the trampoline.  To implement this requirement, define
the following macro.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>ENABLE_EXECUTE_STACK</b><var><a name="index-ENABLE_005fEXECUTE_005fSTACK-3773"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Define this macro if certain operations must be performed before executing
code located on the stack.  The macro should expand to a series of C
file-scope constructs (e.g. functions) and provide a unique entry point
named <code>__enable_execute_stack</code>.  The target is responsible for
emitting calls to the entry point in the code, for example from the
<code>INITIALIZE_TRAMPOLINE</code> macro. 
</p></blockquote></div>

 <p>To use a standard subroutine, define the following macro.  In addition,
you must make sure that the instructions in a trampoline fill an entire
cache line with identical instructions, or else ensure that the
beginning of the trampoline code is always aligned at the same point in
its cache line.  Look in <samp><span class="file">m68k.h</span></samp> as a guide.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>TRANSFER_FROM_TRAMPOLINE</b><var><a name="index-TRANSFER_005fFROM_005fTRAMPOLINE-3774"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Define this macro if trampolines need a special subroutine to do their
work.  The macro should expand to a series of <code>asm</code> statements
which will be compiled with GCC.  They go in a library function named
<code>__transfer_from_trampoline</code>.

      <p>If you need to avoid executing the ordinary prologue code of a compiled
C function when you jump to the subroutine, you can do so by placing a
special label of your own in the assembler code.  Use one <code>asm</code>
statement to generate an assembler label, and another to make the label
global.  Then trampolines can use that label to jump directly to your
special assembler code. 
</p></blockquote></div>
