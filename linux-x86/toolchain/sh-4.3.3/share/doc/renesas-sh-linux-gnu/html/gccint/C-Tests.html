<h4 class="subsection">6.4.4 C Language Testsuites</h4>

<p>GCC contains the following C language testsuites, in the
<samp><span class="file">gcc/testsuite</span></samp> directory:

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="file">gcc.dg</span></samp><dd>This contains tests of particular features of the C compiler, using the
more modern &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dg</span></samp>&rsquo; harness.  Correctness tests for various compiler
features should go here if possible.

     <p>Magic comments determine whether the file
is preprocessed, compiled, linked or run.  In these tests, error and warning
message texts are compared against expected texts or regular expressions
given in comments.  These tests are run with the options &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-ansi -pedantic</span></samp>&rsquo;
unless other options are given in the test.  Except as noted below they
are not run with multiple optimization options. 
<br><dt><samp><span class="file">gcc.dg/compat</span></samp><dd>This subdirectory contains tests for binary compatibility using
<samp><span class="file">compat.exp</span></samp>, which in turn uses the language-independent support
(see <a href="compat-Testing.html#compat-Testing">Support for testing binary compatibility</a>). 
<br><dt><samp><span class="file">gcc.dg/cpp</span></samp><dd>This subdirectory contains tests of the preprocessor. 
<br><dt><samp><span class="file">gcc.dg/debug</span></samp><dd>This subdirectory contains tests for debug formats.  Tests in this
subdirectory are run for each debug format that the compiler supports. 
<br><dt><samp><span class="file">gcc.dg/format</span></samp><dd>This subdirectory contains tests of the <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> format
checking.  Tests in this directory are run with and without
<samp><span class="option">-DWIDE</span></samp>. 
<br><dt><samp><span class="file">gcc.dg/noncompile</span></samp><dd>This subdirectory contains tests of code that should not compile and
does not need any special compilation options.  They are run with
multiple optimization options, since sometimes invalid code crashes
the compiler with optimization. 
<br><dt><samp><span class="file">gcc.dg/special</span></samp><dd>FIXME: describe this.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">gcc.c-torture</span></samp><dd>This contains particular code fragments which have historically broken easily. 
These tests are run with multiple optimization options, so tests for features
which only break at some optimization levels belong here.  This also contains
tests to check that certain optimizations occur.  It might be worthwhile to
separate the correctness tests cleanly from the code quality tests, but
it hasn't been done yet.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">gcc.c-torture/compat</span></samp><dd>FIXME: describe this.

     <p>This directory should probably not be used for new tests. 
<br><dt><samp><span class="file">gcc.c-torture/compile</span></samp><dd>This testsuite contains test cases that should compile, but do not
need to link or run.  These test cases are compiled with several
different combinations of optimization options.  All warnings are
disabled for these test cases, so this directory is not suitable if
you wish to test for the presence or absence of compiler warnings. 
While special options can be set, and tests disabled on specific
platforms, by the use of <samp><span class="file">.x</span></samp> files, mostly these test cases
should not contain platform dependencies.  FIXME: discuss how defines
such as <code>NO_LABEL_VALUES</code> and <code>STACK_SIZE</code> are used. 
<br><dt><samp><span class="file">gcc.c-torture/execute</span></samp><dd>This testsuite contains test cases that should compile, link and run;
otherwise the same comments as for <samp><span class="file">gcc.c-torture/compile</span></samp> apply. 
<br><dt><samp><span class="file">gcc.c-torture/execute/ieee</span></samp><dd>This contains tests which are specific to IEEE floating point. 
<br><dt><samp><span class="file">gcc.c-torture/unsorted</span></samp><dd>FIXME: describe this.

     <p>This directory should probably not be used for new tests. 
<br><dt><samp><span class="file">gcc.c-torture/misc-tests</span></samp><dd>This directory contains C tests that require special handling.  Some
of these tests have individual expect files, and others share
special-purpose expect files:

          <dl>
<dt><samp><code>bprob*.c</code></samp><dd>Test <samp><span class="option">-fbranch-probabilities</span></samp> using <samp><span class="file">bprob.exp</span></samp>, which
in turn uses the generic, language-independent framework
(see <a href="profopt-Testing.html#profopt-Testing">Support for testing profile-directed optimizations</a>).

          <br><dt><samp><code>dg-*.c</code></samp><dd>Test the testsuite itself using <samp><span class="file">dg-test.exp</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><samp><code>gcov*.c</code></samp><dd>Test <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> output using <samp><span class="file">gcov.exp</span></samp>, which in turn uses the
language-independent support (see <a href="gcov-Testing.html#gcov-Testing">Support for testing gcov</a>).

          <br><dt><samp><code>i386-pf-*.c</code></samp><dd>Test i386-specific support for data prefetch using <samp><span class="file">i386-prefetch.exp</span></samp>. 
</dl>

 </dl>

 <p>FIXME: merge in <samp><span class="file">testsuite/README.gcc</span></samp> and discuss the format of
test cases and magic comments more.
