<h3 class="section">10.6 Alias analysis</h3>

<p><a name="index-alias-2112"></a><a name="index-flow_002dsensitive-alias-analysis-2113"></a><a name="index-flow_002dinsensitive-alias-analysis-2114"></a>
Alias analysis proceeds in 4 main phases:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Structural alias analysis.

     <p>This phase walks the types for structure variables, and determines which
of the fields can overlap using offset and size of each field.  For each
field, a &ldquo;subvariable&rdquo; called a &ldquo;Structure field tag&rdquo; (SFT) is
created, which represents that field as a separate variable.  All
accesses that could possibly overlap with a given field will have
virtual operands for the SFT of that field.

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct foo
          {
            int a;
            int b;
          }
          struct foo temp;
          int bar (void)
          {
            int tmp1, tmp2, tmp3;
            SFT.0_2 = VDEF &lt;SFT.0_1&gt;
            temp.a = 5;
            SFT.1_4 = VDEF &lt;SFT.1_3&gt;
            temp.b = 6;
          
            VUSE &lt;SFT.1_4&gt;
            tmp1_5 = temp.b;
            VUSE &lt;SFT.0_2&gt;
            tmp2_6 = temp.a;
          
            tmp3_7 = tmp1_5 + tmp2_6;
            return tmp3_7;
          }
</pre>
     <p>If you copy the symbol tag for a variable for some reason, you probably
also want to copy the subvariables for that variable.

     <li>Points-to and escape analysis.

     <p>This phase walks the use-def chains in the SSA web looking for
three things:

          <ul>
<li>Assignments of the form <code>P_i = &amp;VAR</code>
<li>Assignments of the form P_i = malloc()
<li>Pointers and ADDR_EXPR that escape the current function. 
</ul>

     <p>The concept of `escaping' is the same one used in the Java world. 
When a pointer or an ADDR_EXPR escapes, it means that it has been
exposed outside of the current function.  So, assignment to
global variables, function arguments and returning a pointer are
all escape sites.

     <p>This is where we are currently limited.  Since not everything is
renamed into SSA, we lose track of escape properties when a
pointer is stashed inside a field in a structure, for instance. 
In those cases, we are assuming that the pointer does escape.

     <p>We use escape analysis to determine whether a variable is
call-clobbered.  Simply put, if an ADDR_EXPR escapes, then the
variable is call-clobbered.  If a pointer P_i escapes, then all
the variables pointed-to by P_i (and its memory tag) also escape.

     <li>Compute flow-sensitive aliases

     <p>We have two classes of memory tags.  Memory tags associated with
the pointed-to data type of the pointers in the program.  These
tags are called &ldquo;symbol memory tag&rdquo; (SMT).  The other class are
those associated with SSA_NAMEs, called &ldquo;name memory tag&rdquo; (NMT). 
The basic idea is that when adding operands for an INDIRECT_REF
*P_i, we will first check whether P_i has a name tag, if it does
we use it, because that will have more precise aliasing
information.  Otherwise, we use the standard symbol tag.

     <p>In this phase, we go through all the pointers we found in
points-to analysis and create alias sets for the name memory tags
associated with each pointer P_i.  If P_i escapes, we mark
call-clobbered the variables it points to and its tag.

     <li>Compute flow-insensitive aliases

     <p>This pass will compare the alias set of every symbol memory tag and
every addressable variable found in the program.  Given a symbol
memory tag SMT and an addressable variable V.  If the alias sets
of SMT and V conflict (as computed by may_alias_p), then V is
marked as an alias tag and added to the alias set of SMT.

     <p>Every language that wishes to perform language-specific alias analysis
should define a function that computes, given a <code>tree</code>
node, an alias set for the node.  Nodes in different alias sets are not
allowed to alias.  For an example, see the C front-end function
<code>c_get_alias_set</code>.
      </ol>

 <p>For instance, consider the following function:

<pre class="smallexample">     foo (int i)
     {
       int *p, *q, a, b;
     
       if (i &gt; 10)
         p = &amp;a;
       else
         q = &amp;b;
     
       *p = 3;
       *q = 5;
       a = b + 2;
       return *p;
     }
</pre>
 <p>After aliasing analysis has finished, the symbol memory tag for
pointer <code>p</code> will have two aliases, namely variables <code>a</code> and
<code>b</code>. 
Every time pointer <code>p</code> is dereferenced, we want to mark the
operation as a potential reference to <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.

<pre class="smallexample">     foo (int i)
     {
       int *p, a, b;
     
       if (i_2 &gt; 10)
         p_4 = &amp;a;
       else
         p_6 = &amp;b;
       # p_1 = PHI &lt;p_4(1), p_6(2)&gt;;
     
       # a_7 = VDEF &lt;a_3&gt;;
       # b_8 = VDEF &lt;b_5&gt;;
       *p_1 = 3;
     
       # a_9 = VDEF &lt;a_7&gt;
       # VUSE &lt;b_8&gt;
       a_9 = b_8 + 2;
     
       # VUSE &lt;a_9&gt;;
       # VUSE &lt;b_8&gt;;
       return *p_1;
     }
</pre>
 <p>In certain cases, the list of may aliases for a pointer may grow
too large.  This may cause an explosion in the number of virtual
operands inserted in the code.  Resulting in increased memory
consumption and compilation time.

 <p>When the number of virtual operands needed to represent aliased
loads and stores grows too large (configurable with <samp><span class="option">--param
max-aliased-vops</span></samp>), alias sets are grouped to avoid severe
compile-time slow downs and memory consumption.  The alias
grouping heuristic proceeds as follows:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Sort the list of pointers in decreasing number of contributed
virtual operands.

     <li>Take the first pointer from the list and reverse the role
of the memory tag and its aliases.  Usually, whenever an
aliased variable Vi is found to alias with a memory tag
T, we add Vi to the may-aliases set for T.  Meaning that
after alias analysis, we will have:

     <pre class="smallexample">          may-aliases(T) = { V1, V2, V3, ..., Vn }
</pre>
     <p>This means that every statement that references T, will get
<code>n</code> virtual operands for each of the Vi tags.  But, when
alias grouping is enabled, we make T an alias tag and add it
to the alias set of all the Vi variables:

     <pre class="smallexample">          may-aliases(V1) = { T }
          may-aliases(V2) = { T }
          ...
          may-aliases(Vn) = { T }
</pre>
     <p>This has two effects: (a) statements referencing T will only get
a single virtual operand, and, (b) all the variables Vi will now
appear to alias each other.  So, we lose alias precision to
improve compile time.  But, in theory, a program with such a high
level of aliasing should not be very optimizable in the first
place.

     <li>Since variables may be in the alias set of more than one
memory tag, the grouping done in step (2) needs to be extended
to all the memory tags that have a non-empty intersection with
the may-aliases set of tag T.  For instance, if we originally
had these may-aliases sets:

     <pre class="smallexample">          may-aliases(T) = { V1, V2, V3 }
          may-aliases(R) = { V2, V4 }
</pre>
     <p>In step (2) we would have reverted the aliases for T as:

     <pre class="smallexample">          may-aliases(V1) = { T }
          may-aliases(V2) = { T }
          may-aliases(V3) = { T }
</pre>
     <p>But note that now V2 is no longer aliased with R.  We could
add R to may-aliases(V2), but we are in the process of
grouping aliases to reduce virtual operands so what we do is
add V4 to the grouping to obtain:

     <pre class="smallexample">          may-aliases(V1) = { T }
          may-aliases(V2) = { T }
          may-aliases(V3) = { T }
          may-aliases(V4) = { T }
</pre>
     <li>If the total number of virtual operands due to aliasing is
still above the threshold set by max-alias-vops, go back to (2).
      </ol>
