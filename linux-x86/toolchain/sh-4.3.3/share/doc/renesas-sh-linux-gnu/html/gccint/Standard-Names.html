<h3 class="section">14.9 Standard Pattern Names For Generation</h3>

<p><a name="index-standard-pattern-names-2926"></a><a name="index-pattern-names-2927"></a><a name="index-names_002c-pattern-2928"></a>
Here is a table of the instruction names that are meaningful in the RTL
generation pass of the compiler.  Giving one of these names to an
instruction pattern tells the RTL generation pass that it can use the
pattern to accomplish a certain task.

     
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bmov_0040var_007bm_007d_007d-instruction-pattern-2929"></a>
<dl><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mov</span><var>m</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Here <var>m</var> stands for a two-letter machine mode name, in lowercase. 
This instruction pattern moves data with that machine mode from operand
1 to operand 0.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">movsi</span></samp>&rsquo; moves full-word data.

     <p>If operand 0 is a <code>subreg</code> with mode <var>m</var> of a register whose
own mode is wider than <var>m</var>, the effect of this instruction is
to store the specified value in the part of the register that corresponds
to mode <var>m</var>.  Bits outside of <var>m</var>, but which are within the
same target word as the <code>subreg</code> are undefined.  Bits which are
outside the target word are left unchanged.

     <p>This class of patterns is special in several ways.  First of all, each
of these names up to and including full word size <em>must</em> be defined,
because there is no other way to copy a datum from one place to another. 
If there are patterns accepting operands in larger modes,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mov</span><var>m</var></samp>&rsquo; must be defined for integer modes of those sizes.

     <p>Second, these patterns are not used solely in the RTL generation pass. 
Even the reload pass can generate move insns to copy values from stack
slots into temporary registers.  When it does so, one of the operands is
a hard register and the other is an operand that can need to be reloaded
into a register.

     <p><a name="index-force_005freg-2930"></a>Therefore, when given such a pair of operands, the pattern must generate
RTL which needs no reloading and needs no temporary registers&mdash;no
registers other than the operands.  For example, if you support the
pattern with a <code>define_expand</code>, then in such a case the
<code>define_expand</code> mustn't call <code>force_reg</code> or any other such
function which might generate new pseudo registers.

     <p>This requirement exists even for subword modes on a RISC machine where
fetching those modes from memory normally requires several insns and
some temporary registers.

     <p><a name="index-change_005faddress-2931"></a>During reload a memory reference with an invalid address may be passed
as an operand.  Such an address will be replaced with a valid address
later in the reload pass.  In this case, nothing may be done with the
address except to use it as it stands.  If it is copied, it will not be
replaced with a valid address.  No attempt should be made to make such
an address into a valid address and no routine (such as
<code>change_address</code>) that will do so may be called.  Note that
<code>general_operand</code> will fail when applied to such an address.

     <p><a name="index-reload_005fin_005fprogress-2932"></a>The global variable <code>reload_in_progress</code> (which must be explicitly
declared if required) can be used to determine whether such special
handling is required.

     <p>The variety of operands that have reloads depends on the rest of the
machine description, but typically on a RISC machine these can only be
pseudo registers that did not get hard registers, while on other
machines explicit memory references will get optional reloads.

     <p>If a scratch register is required to move an object to or from memory,
it can be allocated using <code>gen_reg_rtx</code> prior to life analysis.

     <p>If there are cases which need scratch registers during or after reload,
you must provide an appropriate secondary_reload target hook.

     <p><a name="index-can_005fcreate_005fpseudo_005fp-2933"></a>The macro <code>can_create_pseudo_p</code> can be used to determine if it
is unsafe to create new pseudo registers.  If this variable is nonzero, then
it is unsafe to call <code>gen_reg_rtx</code> to allocate a new pseudo.

     <p>The constraints on a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mov</span><var>m</var></samp>&rsquo; must permit moving any hard
register to any other hard register provided that
<code>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</code> permits mode <var>m</var> in both registers and
<code>REGISTER_MOVE_COST</code> applied to their classes returns a value of 2.

     <p>It is obligatory to support floating point &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mov</span><var>m</var></samp>&rsquo;
instructions into and out of any registers that can hold fixed point
values, because unions and structures (which have modes <code>SImode</code> or
<code>DImode</code>) can be in those registers and they may have floating
point members.

     <p>There may also be a need to support fixed point &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mov</span><var>m</var></samp>&rsquo;
instructions in and out of floating point registers.  Unfortunately, I
have forgotten why this was so, and I don't know whether it is still
true.  If <code>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</code> rejects fixed point values in
floating point registers, then the constraints of the fixed point
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mov</span><var>m</var></samp>&rsquo; instructions must be designed to avoid ever trying to
reload into a floating point register.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007breload_005fin_007d-instruction-pattern-2934"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007breload_005fout_007d-instruction-pattern-2935"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">reload_in</span><var>m</var></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">reload_out</span><var>m</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>These named patterns have been obsoleted by the target hook
<code>secondary_reload</code>.

     <p>Like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mov</span><var>m</var></samp>&rsquo;, but used when a scratch register is required to
move between operand 0 and operand 1.  Operand 2 describes the scratch
register.  See the discussion of the <code>SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS</code>
macro in see <a href="Register-Classes.html#Register-Classes">Register Classes</a>.

     <p>There are special restrictions on the form of the <code>match_operand</code>s
used in these patterns.  First, only the predicate for the reload
operand is examined, i.e., <code>reload_in</code> examines operand 1, but not
the predicates for operand 0 or 2.  Second, there may be only one
alternative in the constraints.  Third, only a single register class
letter may be used for the constraint; subsequent constraint letters
are ignored.  As a special exception, an empty constraint string
matches the <code>ALL_REGS</code> register class.  This may relieve ports
of the burden of defining an <code>ALL_REGS</code> constraint letter just
for these patterns.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bmovstrict_0040var_007bm_007d_007d-instruction-pattern-2936"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">movstrict</span><var>m</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mov</span><var>m</var></samp>&rsquo; except that if operand 0 is a <code>subreg</code>
with mode <var>m</var> of a register whose natural mode is wider,
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">movstrict</span><var>m</var></samp>&rsquo; instruction is guaranteed not to alter
any of the register except the part which belongs to mode <var>m</var>.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bmovmisalign_0040var_007bm_007d_007d-instruction-pattern-2937"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">movmisalign</span><var>m</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This variant of a move pattern is designed to load or store a value
from a memory address that is not naturally aligned for its mode. 
For a store, the memory will be in operand 0; for a load, the memory
will be in operand 1.  The other operand is guaranteed not to be a
memory, so that it's easy to tell whether this is a load or store.

     <p>This pattern is used by the autovectorizer, and when expanding a
<code>MISALIGNED_INDIRECT_REF</code> expression.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bload_005fmultiple_007d-instruction-pattern-2938"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">load_multiple</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Load several consecutive memory locations into consecutive registers. 
Operand 0 is the first of the consecutive registers, operand 1
is the first memory location, and operand 2 is a constant: the
number of consecutive registers.

     <p>Define this only if the target machine really has such an instruction;
do not define this if the most efficient way of loading consecutive
registers from memory is to do them one at a time.

     <p>On some machines, there are restrictions as to which consecutive
registers can be stored into memory, such as particular starting or
ending register numbers or only a range of valid counts.  For those
machines, use a <code>define_expand</code> (see <a href="Expander-Definitions.html#Expander-Definitions">Expander Definitions</a>)
and make the pattern fail if the restrictions are not met.

     <p>Write the generated insn as a <code>parallel</code> with elements being a
<code>set</code> of one register from the appropriate memory location (you may
also need <code>use</code> or <code>clobber</code> elements).  Use a
<code>match_parallel</code> (see <a href="RTL-Template.html#RTL-Template">RTL Template</a>) to recognize the insn.  See
<samp><span class="file">rs6000.md</span></samp> for examples of the use of this insn pattern.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bstore_005fmultiple_007d-instruction-pattern-2939"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">store_multiple</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Similar to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">load_multiple</span></samp>&rsquo;, but store several consecutive registers
into consecutive memory locations.  Operand 0 is the first of the
consecutive memory locations, operand 1 is the first register, and
operand 2 is a constant: the number of consecutive registers.

Usually, you specify <code>word_mode</code> for <var>m</var>.  However, if you can
generate better code knowing the range of valid lengths is smaller than
those representable in a full word, you should provide a pattern with a

from an object of mode <code>Pmode</code>.  Do not define these patterns on
such machines.

     <p>Some machines require special handling for stack pointer saves and
restores.  On those machines, define the patterns corresponding to the
non-standard cases by using a <code>define_expand</code> (see <a href="Expander-Definitions.html#Expander-Definitions">Expander Definitions</a>) that produces the required insns.  The three types of
saves and restores are:

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">save_stack_block</span></samp>&rsquo; saves the stack pointer at the start of a block
that allocates a variable-sized object, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">restore_stack_block</span></samp>&rsquo;
restores the stack pointer when the block is exited.

          <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">save_stack_function</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">restore_stack_function</span></samp>&rsquo; do a
similar job for the outermost block of a function and are used when the
function allocates variable-sized objects or calls <code>alloca</code>.  Only
the epilogue uses the restored stack pointer, allowing a simpler save or
restore sequence on some machines.

          <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">save_stack_nonlocal</span></samp>&rsquo; is used in functions that contain labels
branched to by nested functions.  It saves the stack pointer in such a
way that the inner function can use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">restore_stack_nonlocal</span></samp>&rsquo; to
restore the stack pointer.  The compiler generates code to restore the
frame and argument pointer registers, but some machines require saving
and restoring additional data such as register window information or
stack backchains.  Place insns in these patterns to save and restore any
such required data.
          </ol>

     <p>When saving the stack pointer, operand 0 is the save area and operand 1
is the stack pointer.  The mode used to allocate the save area defaults
to <code>Pmode</code> but you can override that choice by defining the
<code>STACK_SAVEAREA_MODE</code> macro (see <a href="Storage-Layout.html#Storage-Layout">Storage Layout</a>).  You must
specify an integral mode, or <code>VOIDmode</code> if no save area is needed
for a particular type of save (either because no save is needed or
because a machine-specific save area can be used).  Operand 0 is the
stack pointer and operand 1 is the save area for restore operations.  If
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">save_stack_block</span></samp>&rsquo; is defined, operand 0 must not be
<code>VOIDmode</code> since these saves can be arbitrarily nested.

     <p>A save area is a <code>mem</code> that is at a constant offset from
<code>virtual_stack_vars_rtx</code> when the stack pointer is saved for use by
nonlocal gotos and a <code>reg</code> in the other two cases.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007ballocate_005fstack_007d-instruction-pattern-3112"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">allocate_stack</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Subtract (or add if <code>STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD</code> is undefined) operand 1 from
the stack pointer to create space for dynamically allocated data.

     <p>Store the resultant pointer to this space into operand 0.  If you
are allocating space from the main stack, do this by emitting a
move insn to copy <code>virtual_stack_dynamic_rtx</code> to operand 0. 
If you are allocating the space elsewhere, generate code to copy the
location of the space to operand 0.  In the latter case, you must
ensure this space gets freed when the corresponding space on the main
stack is free.

     <p>Do not define this pattern if all that must be done is the subtraction. 
Some machines require other operations such as stack probes or
maintaining the back chain.  Define this pattern to emit those
operations in addition to updating the stack pointer.

a load or store instruction (see <a href="Stack-Checking.html#Stack-Checking">Stack Checking</a>), define this pattern
to perform the needed check and signaling an error if the stack
has overflowed.  The single operand is the location in the stack furthest
from the current stack pointer that you need to validate.  Normally,
on machines where this pattern is needed, you would obtain the stack
limit from a global or thread-specific variable or register.

the address to branch to (code to dispatch to the actual label),
the third is the address of a location where the stack is saved,
and the last is the address of the label, to be placed in the
location for the incoming static chain.

     <p>On most machines you need not define this pattern, since GCC will
already generate the correct code, which is to load the frame pointer
and static chain, restore the stack (using the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">restore_stack_nonlocal</span></samp>&rsquo; pattern, if defined), and jump indirectly
to the dispatcher.  You need only define this pattern if this code will

that is shared by all functions of a given module need not be restored.

the constant 0 should be rejected with <code>FAIL</code>, and the true contents
of the memory operand are implementation defined.

     <p>This pattern must issue any memory barrier instructions such that the
pattern as a whole acts as a release barrier, that is the lock is
released only after all previous memory operations have completed.

     <p>If this pattern is not defined, then a <code>memory_barrier</code> pattern
will be emitted, followed by a store of the value to the memory operand.

This pattern, if defined, moves a <code>Pmode</code> value from the memory
in operand 1 to the memory in operand 0 without leaving the value in
a register afterward.  This is to avoid leaking the value some place
that an attacker might use to rewrite the stack guard slot after
having clobbered it.

     <p>If this pattern is not defined, then a plain move pattern is generated.

This pattern, if defined, compares a <code>Pmode</code> value from the
memory in operand 1 with the memory in operand 0 without leaving the
value in a register afterward and branches to operand 2 if the values
weren't equal.

     <p>If this pattern is not defined, then a plain compare pattern and
conditional branch pattern is used.

This pattern, if defined, flushes the instruction cache for a region of
memory.  The region is bounded to by the Pmode pointers in operand 0
inclusive and operand 1 exclusive.

     <p>If this pattern is not defined, a call to the library function
<code>__clear_cache</code> is used.
