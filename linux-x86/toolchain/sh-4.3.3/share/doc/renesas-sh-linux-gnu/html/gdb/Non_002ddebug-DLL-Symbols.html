<h5 class="subsubsection">20.1.5.1 Support for DLLs without Debugging Symbols</h5>

<p><a name="index-DLLs-with-no-debugging-symbols-1097"></a><a name="index-Minimal-symbols-and-DLLs-1098"></a>
Very often on windows, some of the DLLs that your program relies on do
not include symbolic debugging information (for example,
<samp><span class="file">kernel32.dll</span></samp>).  When <span class="sc">gdb</span> doesn't recognize any debugging
symbols in a DLL, it relies on the minimal amount of symbolic
information contained in the DLL's export table.  This section
describes working with such symbols, known internally to <span class="sc">gdb</span> as
&ldquo;minimal symbols&rdquo;.

   <p>Note that before the debugged program has started execution, no DLLs
will have been loaded.  The easiest way around this problem is simply to
start the program &mdash; either by setting a breakpoint or letting the
program run once to completion.  It is also possible to force
<span class="sc">gdb</span> to load a particular DLL before starting the executable &mdash;
see the shared library information in <a href="Files.html#Files">Files</a>, or the
<code>dll-symbols</code> command in <a href="Cygwin-Native.html#Cygwin-Native">Cygwin Native</a>.  Currently,
explicitly loading symbols from a DLL with no debugging information will
cause the symbol names to be duplicated in <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s lookup table,
which may adversely affect symbol lookup performance.

<h5 class="subsubsection">20.1.5.2 DLL Name Prefixes</h5>

<p>In keeping with the naming conventions used by the Microsoft debugging
tools, DLL export symbols are made available with a prefix based on the
DLL name, for instance <code>KERNEL32!CreateFileA</code>.  The plain name is
also entered into the symbol table, so <code>CreateFileA</code> is often
sufficient. In some cases there will be name clashes within a program
(particularly if the executable itself includes full debugging symbols)
necessitating the use of the fully qualified name when referring to the
contents of the DLL. Use single-quotes around the name to avoid the
exclamation mark (&ldquo;!&rdquo;)  being interpreted as a language operator.

   <p>Note that the internal name of the DLL may be all upper-case, even
though the file name of the DLL is lower-case, or vice-versa. Since
symbols within <span class="sc">gdb</span> are <em>case-sensitive</em> this may cause
some confusion. If in doubt, try the <code>info functions</code> and
<code>info variables</code> commands or even <code>maint print msymbols</code>
(see <a href="Symbols.html#Symbols">Symbols</a>). Here's an example:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) info function CreateFileA
     All functions matching regular expression "CreateFileA":
     
     Non-debugging symbols:
     0x77e885f4  CreateFileA
     0x77e885f4  KERNEL32!CreateFileA
</pre>
   <pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) info function !
     All functions matching regular expression "!":
     
     Non-debugging symbols:
     0x6100114c  cygwin1!__assert
     0x61004034  cygwin1!_dll_crt0@0
     0x61004240  cygwin1!dll_crt0(per_process *)
     [etc...]
</pre>
   <h5 class="subsubsection">20.1.5.3 Working with Minimal Symbols</h5>

<p>Symbols extracted from a DLL's export table do not contain very much
type information. All that <span class="sc">gdb</span> can do is guess whether a symbol
refers to a function or variable depending on the linker section that
contains the symbol. Also note that the actual contents of the memory
contained in a DLL are not available unless the program is running. This
means that you cannot examine the contents of a variable or disassemble
a function within a DLL without a running program.

   <p>Variables are generally treated as pointers and dereferenced
automatically. For this reason, it is often necessary to prefix a
variable name with the address-of operator (&ldquo;&amp;&rdquo;) and provide explicit
type information in the command. Here's an example of the type of
problem:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) print 'cygwin1!__argv'
     $1 = 268572168
</pre>
   <pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) x 'cygwin1!__argv'
     0x10021610:      "\230y\""
</pre>
   <p>And two possible solutions:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) print ((char **)'cygwin1!__argv')[0]
     $2 = 0x22fd98 "/cygdrive/c/mydirectory/myprogram"
</pre>
   <pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) x/2x &amp;'cygwin1!__argv'
     0x610c0aa8 &lt;cygwin1!__argv&gt;:    0x10021608      0x00000000
     (gdb) x/x 0x10021608
     0x10021608:     0x0022fd98
     (gdb) x/s 0x0022fd98
     0x22fd98:        "/cygdrive/c/mydirectory/myprogram"
</pre>
   <p>Setting a break point within a DLL is possible even before the program
starts execution. However, under these circumstances, <span class="sc">gdb</span> can't
examine the initial instructions of the function in order to skip the
function's frame set-up code. You can work around this by using &ldquo;*&amp;&rdquo;
to set the breakpoint at a raw memory address:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) break *&amp;'python22!PyOS_Readline'
     Breakpoint 1 at 0x1e04eff0
</pre>
   <p>The author of these extensions is not entirely convinced that setting a
break point within a shared DLL like <samp><span class="file">kernel32.dll</span></samp> is completely
safe.
