<h3 class="section">5.3 Signals</h3>

<p><a name="index-signals-295"></a>
A signal is an asynchronous event that can happen in a program.  The
operating system defines the possible kinds of signals, and gives each
kind a name and a number.  For example, in Unix <code>SIGINT</code> is the
signal a program gets when you type an interrupt character (often <kbd>Ctrl-c</kbd>);
<code>SIGSEGV</code> is the signal a program gets from referencing a place in
memory far away from all the areas in use; <code>SIGALRM</code> occurs when
the alarm clock timer goes off (which happens only if your program has
requested an alarm).

   <p><a name="index-fatal-signals-296"></a>Some signals, including <code>SIGALRM</code>, are a normal part of the
functioning of your program.  Others, such as <code>SIGSEGV</code>, indicate
errors; these signals are <dfn>fatal</dfn> (they kill your program immediately) if the
program has not specified in advance some other way to handle the signal. 
<code>SIGINT</code> does not indicate an error in your program, but it is normally
fatal so it can carry out the purpose of the interrupt: to kill the program.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> has the ability to detect any occurrence of a signal in your
program.  You can tell <span class="sc">gdb</span> in advance what to do for each kind of
signal.

   <p><a name="index-handling-signals-297"></a>Normally, <span class="sc">gdb</span> is set up to let the non-erroneous signals like
<code>SIGALRM</code> be silently passed to your program
(so as not to interfere with their role in the program's functioning)
but to stop your program immediately whenever an error signal happens. 
You can change these settings with the <code>handle</code> command.

<dl><dt><code>info signals</code><dt><code>info handle</code><dd>Print a table of all the kinds of signals and how <span class="sc">gdb</span> has been told to
handle each one.  You can use this to see the signal numbers of all
the defined types of signals.

     <br><dt><code>info signals </code><var>sig</var><dd>Similar, but print information only about the specified signal number.

     <p><code>info handle</code> is an alias for <code>info signals</code>.

     <p><a name="index-handle-300"></a><br><dt><code>handle </code><var>signal</var> <span class="roman">[</span><var>keywords</var><code>...</code><span class="roman">]</span><dd>Change the way <span class="sc">gdb</span> handles signal <var>signal</var>.  <var>signal</var>
can be the number of a signal or its name (with or without the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">SIG</span></samp>&rsquo; at the beginning); a list of signal numbers of the form
&lsquo;<samp><var>low</var><span class="samp">-</span><var>high</var></samp>&rsquo;; or the word &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">all</span></samp>&rsquo;, meaning all the
known signals.  Optional arguments <var>keywords</var>, described below,
say what change to make. 
</dl>

<!-- @group -->
   <p>The keywords allowed by the <code>handle</code> command can be abbreviated. 
Their full names are:

     <dl>
<dt><code>nostop</code><dd><span class="sc">gdb</span> should not stop your program when this signal happens.  It may
still print a message telling you that the signal has come in.

     <br><dt><code>stop</code><dd><span class="sc">gdb</span> should stop your program when this signal happens.  This implies
the <code>print</code> keyword as well.

     <br><dt><code>print</code><dd><span class="sc">gdb</span> should print a message when this signal happens.

     <br><dt><code>noprint</code><dd><span class="sc">gdb</span> should not mention the occurrence of the signal at all.  This
implies the <code>nostop</code> keyword as well.

     <br><dt><code>pass</code><dt><code>noignore</code><dd><span class="sc">gdb</span> should allow your program to see this signal; your program
can handle the signal, or else it may terminate if the signal is fatal
and not handled.  <code>pass</code> and <code>noignore</code> are synonyms.

     <br><dt><code>nopass</code><dt><code>ignore</code><dd><span class="sc">gdb</span> should not allow your program to see this signal. 
<code>nopass</code> and <code>ignore</code> are synonyms. 
</dl>
   <!-- @end group -->

   <p>When a signal stops your program, the signal is not visible to the
program until you
continue.  Your program sees the signal then, if <code>pass</code> is in
effect for the signal in question <em>at that time</em>.  In other words,
after <span class="sc">gdb</span> reports a signal, you can use the <code>handle</code>
command with <code>pass</code> or <code>nopass</code> to control whether your
program sees that signal when you continue.

   <p>The default is set to <code>nostop</code>, <code>noprint</code>, <code>pass</code> for
non-erroneous signals such as <code>SIGALRM</code>, <code>SIGWINCH</code> and
<code>SIGCHLD</code>, and to <code>stop</code>, <code>print</code>, <code>pass</code> for the
erroneous signals.

   <p>You can also use the <code>signal</code> command to prevent your program from
seeing a signal, or cause it to see a signal it normally would not see,
or to give it any signal at any time.  For example, if your program stopped
due to some sort of memory reference error, you might store correct
values into the erroneous variables and continue, hoping to see more
execution; but your program would probably terminate immediately as
a result of the fatal signal once it saw the signal.  To prevent this,
you can continue with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">signal 0</span></samp>&rsquo;.  See <a href="Signaling.html#Signaling">Giving your Program a Signal</a>.
