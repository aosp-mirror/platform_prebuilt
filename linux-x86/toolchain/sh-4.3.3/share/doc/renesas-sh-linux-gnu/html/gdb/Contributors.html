<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Contributors to <span class="sc">gdb</span></h3>

<p>Richard Stallman was the original author of <span class="sc">gdb</span>, and of many
other <span class="sc">gnu</span> programs.  Many others have contributed to its
development.  This section attempts to credit major contributors.  One
of the virtues of free software is that everyone is free to contribute
to it; with regret, we cannot actually acknowledge everyone here.  The
file <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> in the <span class="sc">gdb</span> distribution approximates a
blow-by-blow account.

   <p>Changes much prior to version 2.0 are lost in the mists of time.

   <blockquote>
<em>Plea:</em> Additions to this section are particularly welcome.  If you
or your friends (or enemies, to be evenhanded) have been unfairly
omitted from this list, we would like to add your names! 
</blockquote>

   <p>So that they may not regard their many labors as thankless, we
particularly thank those who shepherded <span class="sc">gdb</span> through major
releases:
Andrew Cagney (releases 6.3, 6.2, 6.1, 6.0, 5.3, 5.2, 5.1 and 5.0);
Jim Blandy (release 4.18);
Jason Molenda (release 4.17);
Stan Shebs (release 4.14);
Fred Fish (releases 4.16, 4.15, 4.13, 4.12, 4.11, 4.10, and 4.9);
Stu Grossman and John Gilmore (releases 4.8, 4.7, 4.6, 4.5, and 4.4);
John Gilmore (releases 4.3, 4.2, 4.1, 4.0, and 3.9);
Jim Kingdon (releases 3.5, 3.4, and 3.3);
and Randy Smith (releases 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0).

   <p>Richard Stallman, assisted at various times by Peter TerMaat, Chris

   <p>Michael Tiemann is the author of most of the <span class="sc">gnu</span> C<tt>++</tt> support
in <span class="sc">gdb</span>, with significant additional contributions from Per
Bothner and Daniel Berlin.  James Clark wrote the <span class="sc">gnu</span> C<tt>++</tt>
demangler.  Early work on C<tt>++</tt> was by Peter TerMaat (who also did
much general update work leading to release 3.0).

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> uses the BFD subroutine library to examine multiple
object-file formats; BFD was a joint project of David V. 
Henkel-Wallace, Rich Pixley, Steve Chamberlain, and John Gilmore.

about several machine instruction sets.

   <p>Patrick Duval, Ted Goldstein, Vikram Koka and Glenn Engel helped develop
remote debugging.  Intel Corporation, Wind River Systems, AMD, and ARM
contributed remote debugging modules for the i960, VxWorks, A29K UDI,
and RDI targets, respectively.

   <p>Brian Fox is the author of the readline libraries providing
command-line editing and command history.

   <p>Andrew Beers of SUNY Buffalo wrote the language-switching code, the
Modula-2 support, and contributed the Languages chapter of this manual.

He also enhanced the command-completion support to cover C<tt>++</tt> overloaded
symbols.

   <p>Hitachi America (now Renesas America), Ltd. sponsored the support for
H8/300, H8/500, and Super-H processors.

   <p>NEC sponsored the support for the v850, Vr4xxx, and Vr5xxx processors.

   <p>Matsushita sponsored the support for the MN10200 and MN10300 processors.

   <p>Fujitsu sponsored the support for SPARClite and FR30 processors.

   <p>Kung Hsu, Jeff Law, and Rick Sladkey added support for hardware
watchpoints.

   <p>Michael Snyder added support for tracepoints.

   <p>Stu Grossman wrote gdbserver.

   <p>Jim Kingdon, Peter Schauer, Ian Taylor, and Stu Grossman made
nearly innumerable bug fixes and cleanups throughout <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

   <p>The following people at the Hewlett-Packard Company contributed
support for the PA-RISC 2.0 architecture, HP-UX 10.20, 10.30, and 11.0

Duffek, Richard Henderson, Mark Kettenis, Grace Sainsbury, Kei
Sakamoto, Yoshinori Sato, Michael Snyder, Andreas Schwab, Jason
Thorpe, Corinna Vinschen, Ulrich Weigand, and Elena Zannoni, helped
with the migration of old architectures to this new framework.

   <p>Andrew Cagney completely re-designed and re-implemented <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s
unwinder framework, this consisting of a fresh new design featuring
frame IDs, independent frame sniffers, and the sentinel frame.  Mark
Kettenis implemented the <span class="sc">dwarf 2</span> unwinder, Jeff Johnston the
libunwind unwinder, and Andrew Cagney the dummy, sentinel, tramp, and
