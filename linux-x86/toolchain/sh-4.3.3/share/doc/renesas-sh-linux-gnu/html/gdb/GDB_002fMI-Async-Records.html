<h4 class="subsection">26.4.3 <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> Async Records</h4>

<p><a name="index-async-records-in-_0040sc_007bgdb_002fmi_007d-1514"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040sc_007bgdb_002fmi_007d_002c-async-records-1515"></a><dfn>Async</dfn> records are used to notify the <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> client of
additional changes that have occurred.  Those changes can either be a
consequence of <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> commands (e.g., a breakpoint modified) or a result of
target activity (e.g., target stopped).

   <p>The following is the list of possible async records:

     <dl>
<dt><code>*running,thread-id="</code><var>thread</var><code>"</code><dd>The target is now running.  The <var>thread</var> field tells which
specific thread is now running, and can be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">all</span></samp>&rsquo; if all threads
are running.  The frontend should assume that no interaction with a
running thread is possible after this notification is produced. 
The frontend should not assume that this notification is output
only once for any command.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> may emit this notification
several times, either for different threads, because it cannot resume
all threads together, or even for a single thread, if the thread must
be stepped though some code before letting it run freely.

     <br><dt><code>*stopped,reason="</code><var>reason</var><code>"</code><dd>The target has stopped.  The <var>reason</var> field can have one of the
following values:

          <dl>
<dt><code>breakpoint-hit</code><dd>A breakpoint was reached. 
<br><dt><code>watchpoint-trigger</code><dd>A watchpoint was triggered. 
<br><dt><code>read-watchpoint-trigger</code><dd>A read watchpoint was triggered. 
<br><dt><code>access-watchpoint-trigger</code><dd>An access watchpoint was triggered. 
<br><dt><code>function-finished</code><dd>An -exec-finish or similar CLI command was accomplished. 
<br><dt><code>location-reached</code><dd>An -exec-until or similar CLI command was accomplished. 
<br><dt><code>watchpoint-scope</code><dd>A watchpoint has gone out of scope. 
<br><dt><code>end-stepping-range</code><dd>An -exec-next, -exec-next-instruction, -exec-step, -exec-step-instruction or
similar CLI command was accomplished. 
<br><dt><code>exited-signalled</code><dd>The inferior exited because of a signal. 
<br><dt><code>exited</code><dd>The inferior exited. 
<br><dt><code>exited-normally</code><dd>The inferior exited normally. 
<br><dt><code>signal-received</code><dd>A signal was received by the inferior. 
</dl>

     <br><dt><code>=thread-created,id="</code><var>id</var><code>"</code><dt><code>=thread-exited,id="</code><var>id</var><code>"</code><dd>A thread either was created, or has exited.  The <var>id</var> field
contains the <span class="sc">gdb</span> identifier of the thread. 
</dl>
