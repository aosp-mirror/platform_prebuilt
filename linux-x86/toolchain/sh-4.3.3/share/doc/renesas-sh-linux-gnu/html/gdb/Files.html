<h3 class="section">17.1 Commands to Specify Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-symbol-table-837"></a><a name="index-core-dump-file-838"></a>
You may want to specify executable and core dump file names.  The usual
way to do this is at start-up time, using the arguments to
<span class="sc">gdb</span>'s start-up commands (see <a href="Invocation.html#Invocation">Getting In and Out of <span class="sc">gdb</span></a>).

   <p>Occasionally it is necessary to change to a different file during a
<span class="sc">gdb</span> session.  Or you may run <span class="sc">gdb</span> and forget to
specify a file you want to use.  Or you are debugging a remote target
via <code>gdbserver</code> (see <a href="Server.html#Server">file</a>).  In these situations the <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands to specify
new files are useful.

     
<a name="index-executable-file-839"></a>
<a name="index-file-840"></a>
<dl><dt><code>file </code><var>filename</var><dd>Use <var>filename</var> as the program to be debugged.  It is read for its
symbols and for the contents of pure memory.  It is also the program
executed when you use the <code>run</code> command.  If you do not specify a
directory and the file is not found in the <span class="sc">gdb</span> working directory,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> uses the environment variable <code>PATH</code> as a list of
directories to search, just as the shell does when looking for a program
to run.  You can change the value of this variable, for both <span class="sc">gdb</span>
and your program, using the <code>path</code> command.

     <p><a name="index-unlinked-object-files-841"></a><a name="index-patching-object-files-842"></a>You can load unlinked object <samp><span class="file">.o</span></samp> files into <span class="sc">gdb</span> using
the <code>file</code> command.  You will not be able to &ldquo;run&rdquo; an object
file, but you can disassemble functions and inspect variables.  Also,
if the underlying BFD functionality supports it, you could use
<kbd>gdb -write</kbd> to patch object files using this technique.  Note
that <span class="sc">gdb</span> can neither interpret nor modify relocations in this
case, so branches and some initialized variables will appear to go to
the wrong place.  But this feature is still handy from time to time.

     <br><dt><code>file</code><dd><code>file</code> with no argument makes <span class="sc">gdb</span> discard any information it
has on both executable file and the symbol table.

     <p><a name="index-exec_002dfile-843"></a><br><dt><code>exec-file </code><span class="roman">[</span> <var>filename</var> <span class="roman">]</span><dd>Specify that the program to be run (but not the symbol table) is found
in <var>filename</var>.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> searches the environment variable <code>PATH</code>
if necessary to locate your program.  Omitting <var>filename</var> means to
discard information on the executable file.

     <p><a name="index-symbol_002dfile-844"></a><br><dt><code>symbol-file </code><span class="roman">[</span> <var>filename</var> <span class="roman">]</span><dd>Read symbol table information from file <var>filename</var>.  <code>PATH</code> is
searched when necessary.  Use the <code>file</code> command to get both symbol
table and program to run from the same file.

     <p><code>symbol-file</code> with no argument clears out <span class="sc">gdb</span> information on your
program's symbol table.

     <p>The <code>symbol-file</code> command causes <span class="sc">gdb</span> to forget the contents of
some breakpoints and auto-display expressions.  This is because they may
contain pointers to the internal data recording symbols and data types,
which are part of the old symbol table data being discarded inside
<span class="sc">gdb</span>.

     <p><code>symbol-file</code> does not repeat if you press &lt;RET&gt; again after
executing it once.

     <p>When <span class="sc">gdb</span> is configured for a particular environment, it
understands debugging information in whatever format is the standard
generated for that environment; you may use either a <span class="sc">gnu</span> compiler, or
other compilers that adhere to the local conventions. 
Best results are usually obtained from <span class="sc">gnu</span> compilers; for example,
using <span class="sc">gcc</span> you can generate debugging information for
optimized code.

     <p>For most kinds of object files, with the exception of old SVR3 systems
using COFF, the <code>symbol-file</code> command does not normally read the
symbol table in full right away.  Instead, it scans the symbol table
quickly to find which source files and which symbols are present.  The
details are read later, one source file at a time, as they are needed.

     <p>The purpose of this two-stage reading strategy is to make <span class="sc">gdb</span>
start up faster.  For the most part, it is invisible except for
occasional pauses while the symbol table details for a particular source
file are being read.  (The <code>set verbose</code> command can turn these
pauses into messages if desired.  See <a href="Messages_002fWarnings.html#Messages_002fWarnings">Optional Warnings and Messages</a>.)

     <p>We have not implemented the two-stage strategy for COFF yet.  When the
symbol table is stored in COFF format, <code>symbol-file</code> reads the
symbol table data in full right away.  Note that &ldquo;stabs-in-COFF&rdquo;
still does the two-stage strategy, since the debug info is actually
in stabs format.

     <p><a name="index-readnow-845"></a><a name="index-reading-symbols-immediately-846"></a><a name="index-symbols_002c-reading-immediately-847"></a><br><dt><code>symbol-file </code><var>filename</var> <span class="roman">[</span><code> -readnow </code><span class="roman">]</span><dt><code>file </code><var>filename</var> <span class="roman">[</span><code> -readnow </code><span class="roman">]</span><dd>You can override the <span class="sc">gdb</span> two-stage strategy for reading symbol
tables by using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-readnow</span></samp>&rsquo; option with any of the commands that
load symbol table information, if you want to be sure <span class="sc">gdb</span> has the
entire symbol table available.

     <!-- FIXME: for now no mention of directories, since this seems to be in -->
     <!-- flux.  13mar1992 status is that in theory GDB would look either in -->
     <!-- current dir or in same dir as myprog; but issues like competing -->
     <!-- GDB's, or clutter in system dirs, mean that in practice right now -->
     <!-- only current dir is used.  FFish says maybe a special GDB hierarchy -->
     <!-- (eg rooted in val of env var GDBSYMS) could exist for mappable symbol -->
     <!-- files. -->
     <p><a name="index-core_002dfile-848"></a><br><dt><code>core-file </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>filename</var><span class="roman">]</span><dt><code>core</code><dd>Specify the whereabouts of a core dump file to be used as the &ldquo;contents
of memory&rdquo;.  Traditionally, core files contain only some parts of the
address space of the process that generated them; <span class="sc">gdb</span> can access the
executable file itself for other parts.

     <p><code>core-file</code> with no argument specifies that no core file is
to be used.

     <p>Note that the core file is ignored when your program is actually running
under <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  So, if you have been running your program and you
wish to debug a core file instead, you must kill the subprocess in which
the program is running.  To do this, use the <code>kill</code> command
(see <a href="Kill-Process.html#Kill-Process">Killing the Child Process</a>).

     <p><a name="index-add_002dsymbol_002dfile-849"></a><a name="index-dynamic-linking-850"></a><br><dt><code>add-symbol-file </code><var>filename</var> <var>address</var><dt><code>add-symbol-file </code><var>filename</var> <var>address</var> <span class="roman">[</span><code> -readnow </code><span class="roman">]</span><dt><code>add-symbol-file </code><var>filename</var> <span class="roman">-s</span><var>section</var> <var>address</var><code> ...</code><dd>The <code>add-symbol-file</code> command reads additional symbol table
information from the file <var>filename</var>.  You would use this command
when <var>filename</var> has been dynamically loaded (by some other means)
into the program that is running.  <var>address</var> should be the memory
address at which the file has been loaded; <span class="sc">gdb</span> cannot figure
this out for itself.  You can additionally specify an arbitrary number
of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-s</span><var>section</var> <var>address</var></samp>&rsquo; pairs, to give an explicit
section name and base address for that section.  You can specify any
<var>address</var> as an expression.

     <p>The symbol table of the file <var>filename</var> is added to the symbol table
originally read with the <code>symbol-file</code> command.  You can use the
<code>add-symbol-file</code> command any number of times; the new symbol data
thus read keeps adding to the old.  To discard all old symbol data
instead, use the <code>symbol-file</code> command without any arguments.

     <p><a name="index-relocatable-object-files_002c-reading-symbols-from-851"></a><a name="index-object-files_002c-relocatable_002c-reading-symbols-from-852"></a><a name="index-reading-symbols-from-relocatable-object-files-853"></a><a name="index-symbols_002c-reading-from-relocatable-object-files-854"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_002eo_007d-files_002c-reading-symbols-from-855"></a>Although <var>filename</var> is typically a shared library file, an
executable file, or some other object file which has been fully
relocated for loading into a process, you can also load symbolic
information from relocatable <samp><span class="file">.o</span></samp> files, as long as:

          <ul>
<li>the file's symbolic information refers only to linker symbols defined in
that file, not to symbols defined by other object files,
<li>every section the file's symbolic information refers to has actually
been loaded into the inferior, as it appears in the file, and
<li>you can determine the address at which every section was loaded, and
provide these to the <code>add-symbol-file</code> command. 
</ul>

     <p class="noindent">Some embedded operating systems, like Sun Chorus and VxWorks, can load
relocatable files into an already running program; such systems
typically make the requirements above easy to meet.  However, it's
important to recognize that many native systems use complex link
procedures (<code>.linkonce</code> section factoring and C<tt>++</tt> constructor table
assembly, for example) that make the requirements difficult to meet.  In
general, one cannot assume that using <code>add-symbol-file</code> to read a
relocatable object file's symbolic information will have the same effect
as linking the relocatable object file into the program in the normal
way.

     <p><code>add-symbol-file</code> does not repeat if you press &lt;RET&gt; after using it.

     <p><a name="index-add_002dsymbol_002dfile_002dfrom_002dmemory-856"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bsyscall-DSO_007d-857"></a><a name="index-load-symbols-from-memory-858"></a><br><dt><code>add-symbol-file-from-memory </code><var>address</var><dd>Load symbols from the given <var>address</var> in a dynamically loaded
object file whose image is mapped directly into the inferior's memory. 
For example, the Linux kernel maps a <code>syscall DSO</code> into each
process's address space; this DSO provides kernel-specific code for
some system calls.  The argument can be any expression whose
evaluation yields the address of the file's shared object file header. 
For this command to work, you must have used <code>symbol-file</code> or
<code>exec-file</code> commands in advance.

     <p><a name="index-add_002dshared_002dsymbol_002dfiles-859"></a><a name="index-assf-860"></a><br><dt><code>add-shared-symbol-files </code><var>library-file</var><dt><code>assf </code><var>library-file</var><dd>The <code>add-shared-symbol-files</code> command can currently be used only
in the Cygwin build of <span class="sc">gdb</span> on MS-Windows OS, where it is an
alias for the <code>dll-symbols</code> command (see <a href="Cygwin-Native.html#Cygwin-Native">Cygwin Native</a>). 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> automatically looks for shared libraries, however if
<span class="sc">gdb</span> does not find yours, you can invoke
<code>add-shared-symbol-files</code>.  It takes one argument: the shared
library's file name.  <code>assf</code> is a shorthand alias for
<code>add-shared-symbol-files</code>.

     <p><a name="index-section-861"></a><br><dt><code>section </code><var>section</var> <var>addr</var><dd>The <code>section</code> command changes the base address of the named
<var>section</var> of the exec file to <var>addr</var>.  This can be used if the
exec file does not contain section addresses, (such as in the
<code>a.out</code> format), or when the addresses specified in the file
itself are wrong.  Each section must be changed separately.  The
<code>info files</code> command, described below, lists all the sections and
their addresses.

     <p><a name="index-info-files-862"></a><a name="index-info-target-863"></a><br><dt><code>info files</code><dt><code>info target</code><dd><code>info files</code> and <code>info target</code> are synonymous; both print the
current target (see <a href="Targets.html#Targets">Specifying a Debugging Target</a>),
including the names of the executable and core dump files currently in
use by <span class="sc">gdb</span>, and the files from which symbols were loaded.  The
command <code>help target</code> lists all possible targets rather than
current ones.

     <p><a name="index-maint-info-sections-864"></a><br><dt><code>maint info sections</code><dd>Another command that can give you extra information about program sections
is <code>maint info sections</code>.  In addition to the section information
displayed by <code>info files</code>, this command displays the flags and file
offset of each section in the executable and core dump files.  In addition,
<code>maint info sections</code> provides the following command options (which
may be arbitrarily combined):

          <dl>
<dt><code>ALLOBJ</code><dd>Display sections for all loaded object files, including shared libraries. 
<br><dt><var>sections</var><dd>Display info only for named <var>sections</var>. 
<br><dt><var>section-flags</var><dd>Display info only for sections for which <var>section-flags</var> are true. 
The section flags that <span class="sc">gdb</span> currently knows about are:
               <dl>
<dt><code>ALLOC</code><dd>Section will have space allocated in the process when loaded. 
Set for all sections except those containing debug information. 
<br><dt><code>LOAD</code><dd>Section will be loaded from the file into the child process memory. 
Set for pre-initialized code and data, clear for <code>.bss</code> sections. 
<br><dt><code>RELOC</code><dd>Section needs to be relocated before loading. 
<br><dt><code>READONLY</code><dd>Section cannot be modified by the child process. 
<br><dt><code>CODE</code><dd>Section contains executable code only. 
<br><dt><code>DATA</code><dd>Section contains data only (no executable code). 
<br><dt><code>ROM</code><dd>Section will reside in ROM. 
<br><dt><code>CONSTRUCTOR</code><dd>Section contains data for constructor/destructor lists. 
<br><dt><code>HAS_CONTENTS</code><dd>Section is not empty. 
<br><dt><code>NEVER_LOAD</code><dd>An instruction to the linker to not output the section. 
<br><dt><code>COFF_SHARED_LIBRARY</code><dd>A notification to the linker that the section contains
COFF shared library information. 
<br><dt><code>IS_COMMON</code><dd>Section contains common symbols. 
</dl>
          </dl>
     <a name="index-set-trust_002dreadonly_002dsections-865"></a><a name="index-read_002donly-sections-866"></a><br><dt><code>set trust-readonly-sections on</code><dd>Tell <span class="sc">gdb</span> that readonly sections in your object file
really are read-only (i.e. that their contents will not change). 
In that case, <span class="sc">gdb</span> can fetch values from these sections
out of the object file, rather than from the target program. 
For some targets (notably embedded ones), this can be a significant
enhancement to debugging performance.

     <p>The default is off.

     <br><dt><code>set trust-readonly-sections off</code><dd>Tell <span class="sc">gdb</span> not to trust readonly sections.  This means that
the contents of the section might change while the program is running,
and must therefore be fetched from the target when needed.

     <br><dt><code>show trust-readonly-sections</code><dd>Show the current setting of trusting readonly sections. 
</dl>

   <p>All file-specifying commands allow both absolute and relative file names
as arguments.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> always converts the file name to an absolute file
name and remembers it that way.

   <p><a name="index-shared-libraries-867"></a><a name="Shared-Libraries"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> supports <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux, MS-Windows, HP-UX, SunOS, SVr4, Irix,
and IBM RS/6000 AIX shared libraries.

   <p>On MS-Windows <span class="sc">gdb</span> must be linked with the Expat library to support
shared libraries.  See <a href="Expat.html#Expat">Expat</a>.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> automatically loads symbol definitions from shared libraries
when you use the <code>run</code> command, or when you examine a core file. 
(Before you issue the <code>run</code> command, <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not understand
references to a function in a shared library, however&mdash;unless you are
debugging a core file).

   <p>On HP-UX, if the program loads a library explicitly, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
automatically loads the symbols at the time of the <code>shl_load</code> call.

<!-- FIXME: some @value{GDBN} release may permit some refs to undef -->
<!-- FIXME...symbols-eg in a break cmd-assuming they are from a shared -->
<!-- FIXME...lib; check this from time to time when updating manual -->
   <p>There are times, however, when you may wish to not automatically load
symbol definitions from shared libraries, such as when they are
particularly large or there are many of them.

   <p>To control the automatic loading of shared library symbols, use the
commands:

     
<a name="index-set-auto_002dsolib_002dadd-868"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set auto-solib-add </code><var>mode</var><dd>If <var>mode</var> is <code>on</code>, symbols from all shared object libraries
will be loaded automatically when the inferior begins execution, you
attach to an independently started inferior, or when the dynamic linker
informs <span class="sc">gdb</span> that a new library has been loaded.  If <var>mode</var>
is <code>off</code>, symbols must be loaded manually, using the
<code>sharedlibrary</code> command.  The default value is <code>on</code>.

     <p><a name="index-memory-used-for-symbol-tables-869"></a>If your program uses lots of shared libraries with debug info that
takes large amounts of memory, you can decrease the <span class="sc">gdb</span>
memory footprint by preventing it from automatically loading the
symbols from shared libraries.  To that end, type <kbd>set
auto-solib-add off</kbd> before running the inferior, then load each
library whose debug symbols you do need with <kbd>sharedlibrary
</kbd><var>regexp</var>, where <var>regexp</var> is a regular expression that matches
the libraries whose symbols you want to be loaded.

     <p><a name="index-show-auto_002dsolib_002dadd-870"></a><br><dt><code>show auto-solib-add</code><dd>Display the current autoloading mode. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-load-shared-library-871"></a>To explicitly load shared library symbols, use the <code>sharedlibrary</code>
command:

     
<a name="index-info-sharedlibrary-872"></a>
<a name="index-info-share-873"></a>
<dl><dt><code>info share</code><dt><code>info sharedlibrary</code><dd>Print the names of the shared libraries which are currently loaded.

     <p><a name="index-sharedlibrary-874"></a><a name="index-share-875"></a><br><dt><code>sharedlibrary </code><var>regex</var><dt><code>share </code><var>regex</var><dd>Load shared object library symbols for files matching a
Unix regular expression. 
As with files loaded automatically, it only loads shared libraries
required by your program for a core file or after typing <code>run</code>.  If
<var>regex</var> is omitted all shared libraries required by your program are
loaded.

     <br><dt><code>nosharedlibrary</code><dd><a name="index-nosharedlibrary-876"></a><a name="index-unload-symbols-from-shared-libraries-877"></a>Unload all shared object library symbols.  This discards all symbols
that have been loaded from all shared libraries.  Symbols from shared
libraries that were loaded by explicit user requests are not
discarded. 
</dl>

   <p>Sometimes you may wish that <span class="sc">gdb</span> stops and gives you control
when any of shared library events happen.  Use the <code>set
stop-on-solib-events</code> command for this:

     <dl>
<dt><code>set stop-on-solib-events</code><dd><a name="index-set-stop_002don_002dsolib_002devents-878"></a>This command controls whether <span class="sc">gdb</span> should give you control
when the dynamic linker notifies it about some shared library event. 
The most common event of interest is loading or unloading of a new
shared library.

     <br><dt><code>show stop-on-solib-events</code><dd><a name="index-show-stop_002don_002dsolib_002devents-879"></a>Show whether <span class="sc">gdb</span> stops and gives you control when shared
library events happen. 
</dl>

   <p>Shared libraries are also supported in many cross or remote debugging
configurations.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> needs to have access to the target's libraries;
this can be accomplished either by providing copies of the libraries
on the host system, or by asking <span class="sc">gdb</span> to automatically retrieve the
libraries from the target.  If copies of the target libraries are
provided, they need to be the same as the target libraries, although the
copies on the target can be stripped as long as the copies on the host are
not.

   <p><a name="index-where-to-look-for-shared-libraries-880"></a>For remote debugging, you need to tell <span class="sc">gdb</span> where the target
libraries are, so that it can load the correct copies&mdash;otherwise, it
may try to load the host's libraries.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> has two variables
to specify the search directories for target libraries.

     
<a name="index-prefix-for-shared-library-file-names-881"></a>
<a name="index-system-root_002c-alternate-882"></a>
<a name="index-set-solib_002dabsolute_002dprefix-883"></a>
<a name="index-set-sysroot-884"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set sysroot </code><var>path</var><dd>Use <var>path</var> as the system root for the program being debugged.  Any
absolute shared library paths will be prefixed with <var>path</var>; many
runtime loaders store the absolute paths to the shared library in the
target program's memory.  If you use <code>set sysroot</code> to find shared
libraries, they need to be laid out in the same way that they are on
the target, with e.g. a <samp><span class="file">/lib</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">/usr/lib</span></samp> hierarchy
under <var>path</var>.

     <p>If <var>path</var> starts with the sequence <samp><span class="file">remote:</span></samp>, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will
retrieve the target libraries from the remote system.  This is only
supported when using a remote target that supports the <code>remote get</code>
command (see <a href="File-Transfer.html#File-Transfer">Sending files to a remote system</a>). 
The part of <var>path</var> following the initial <samp><span class="file">remote:</span></samp>
(if present) is used as system root prefix on the remote file system. 
<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

     <p>The <code>set solib-absolute-prefix</code> command is an alias for <code>set
sysroot</code>.

path to the library is relative instead of absolute.  If you want to
use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">solib-search-path</span></samp>&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sysroot</span></samp>&rsquo;, be sure to set
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sysroot</span></samp>&rsquo; to a nonexistent directory to prevent <span class="sc">gdb</span> from
finding your host's libraries.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sysroot</span></samp>&rsquo; is preferred; setting
it to a nonexistent directory may interfere with automatic loading
of shared library symbols.
