<h3 class="section">4.10 Debugging Programs with Multiple Threads</h3>

<p><a name="index-threads-of-execution-142"></a><a name="index-multiple-threads-143"></a><a name="index-switching-threads-144"></a>In some operating systems, such as HP-UX and Solaris, a single program
may have more than one <dfn>thread</dfn> of execution.  The precise semantics
of threads differ from one operating system to another, but in general
the threads of a single program are akin to multiple processes&mdash;except
that they share one address space (that is, they can all examine and
modify the same variables).  On the other hand, each thread has its own
registers and execution stack, and perhaps private memory.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> provides these facilities for debugging multi-thread
programs:

     <ul>
<li>automatic notification of new threads
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">thread </span><var>threadno</var></samp>&rsquo;, a command to switch among threads
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">info threads</span></samp>&rsquo;, a command to inquire about existing threads
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">thread apply [</span><var>threadno</var><span class="samp">] [</span><var>all</var><span class="samp">] </span><var>args</var></samp>&rsquo;,
a command to apply a command to a list of threads
<li>thread-specific breakpoints
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set print thread-events</span></samp>&rsquo;, which controls printing of
messages on thread start and exit. 
</ul>

   <blockquote>
<em>Warning:</em> These facilities are not yet available on every
<span class="sc">gdb</span> configuration where the operating system supports threads. 
If your <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not support threads, these commands have no
effect.  For example, a system without thread support shows no output
from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">info threads</span></samp>&rsquo;, and always rejects the <code>thread</code> command,
like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) info threads
     (gdb) thread 1
     Thread ID 1 not known.  Use the "info threads" command to
     see the IDs of currently known threads.
</pre>
   <!-- FIXME to implementors: how hard would it be to say "sorry, this GDB -->
<!-- doesn't support threads"? -->
   </blockquote>

   <p><a name="index-focus-of-debugging-145"></a><a name="index-current-thread-146"></a>The <span class="sc">gdb</span> thread debugging facility allows you to observe all
threads while your program runs&mdash;but whenever <span class="sc">gdb</span> takes
control, one thread in particular is always the focus of debugging. 
This thread is called the <dfn>current thread</dfn>.  Debugging commands show
program information from the perspective of the current thread.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bNew_007d-_0040var_007bsystag_007d-message-147"></a><a name="index-thread-identifier-_0028system_0029-148"></a><!-- FIXME-implementors!! It would be more helpful if the [New...] message -->
<!-- included GDB's numeric thread handle, so you could just go to that -->
<!-- thread without first checking `info threads'. -->
Whenever <span class="sc">gdb</span> detects a new thread in your program, it displays
the target system's identification for the thread with a message in the
form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[New </span><var>systag</var><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo;.  <var>systag</var> is a thread identifier
whose form varies depending on the particular system.  For example, on
<span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux, you might see

<pre class="smallexample">     [New Thread 46912507313328 (LWP 25582)]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">when <span class="sc">gdb</span> notices a new thread.  In contrast, on an SGI system,
the <var>systag</var> is simply something like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">process 368</span></samp>&rsquo;, with no
further qualifier.

<!-- FIXME!! (1) Does the [New...] message appear even for the very first -->
<!-- thread of a program, or does it only appear for the -->
<!-- second-i.e.@: when it becomes obvious we have a multithread -->
<!-- program? -->
<!-- (2) *Is* there necessarily a first thread always?  Or do some -->
<!-- multithread systems permit starting a program with multiple -->
<!-- threads ab initio? -->
   <p><a name="index-thread-number-149"></a><a name="index-thread-identifier-_0028GDB_0029-150"></a>For debugging purposes, <span class="sc">gdb</span> associates its own thread
number&mdash;always a single integer&mdash;with each thread in your program.

     
<a name="index-info-threads-151"></a>
<dl><dt><code>info threads</code><dd>Display a summary of all threads currently in your
program.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> displays for each thread (in this order):

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>the thread number assigned by <span class="sc">gdb</span>

          <li>the target system's thread identifier (<var>systag</var>)

          <li>the current stack frame summary for that thread
          </ol>

     <p class="noindent">An asterisk &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; to the left of the <span class="sc">gdb</span> thread number
indicates the current thread.

     <p>For example,
</dl>
   <!-- end table here to get a little more width for example -->

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) info threads
       3 process 35 thread 27  0x34e5 in sigpause ()
       2 process 35 thread 23  0x34e5 in sigpause ()
     * 1 process 35 thread 13  main (argc=1, argv=0x7ffffff8)
         at threadtest.c:68

   <p>On HP-UX systems:

   <p><a name="index-debugging-multithreaded-programs-_0028on-HP_002dUX_0029-152"></a><a name="index-thread-identifier-_0028GDB_0029_002c-on-HP_002dUX-153"></a>For debugging purposes, <span class="sc">gdb</span> associates its own thread
number&mdash;a small integer assigned in thread-creation order&mdash;with each
thread in your program.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bNew_007d-_0040var_007bsystag_007d-message_002c-on-HP_002dUX-154"></a><a name="index-thread-identifier-_0028system_0029_002c-on-HP_002dUX-155"></a><!-- FIXME-implementors!! It would be more helpful if the [New...] message -->
<!-- included GDB's numeric thread handle, so you could just go to that -->
<!-- thread without first checking `info threads'. -->
Whenever <span class="sc">gdb</span> detects a new thread in your program, it displays
both <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s thread number and the target system's identification for the thread with a message in the
form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[New </span><var>systag</var><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo;.  <var>systag</var> is a thread identifier
whose form varies depending on the particular system.  For example, on
HP-UX, you see

<pre class="smallexample">     [New thread 2 (system thread 26594)]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">when <span class="sc">gdb</span> notices a new thread.

   <p>On Solaris, you can display more information about user threads with a
Solaris-specific command:

     <dl>
<dt><code>maint info sol-threads</code><dd><a name="index-maint-info-sol_002dthreads-157"></a><a name="index-thread-info-_0028Solaris_0029-158"></a>Display info on Solaris user threads.

<dl><dt><code>thread </code><var>threadno</var><dd>Make thread number <var>threadno</var> the current thread.  The command
argument <var>threadno</var> is the internal <span class="sc">gdb</span> thread number, as
shown in the first field of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">info threads</span></samp>&rsquo; display. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> responds by displaying the system identifier of the thread
you selected, and its current stack frame summary:

     <pre class="smallexample">          <!-- FIXME!! This example made up; find a @value{GDBN} w/threads and get real one -->

     <p class="noindent">As with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[New ...]</span></samp>&rsquo; message, the form of the text after
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Switching to</span></samp>&rsquo; depends on your system's conventions for identifying
threads.

started or that threads have exited.  By default, these messages will
be printed if detection of these events is supported by the target. 
Note that these messages cannot be disabled on all targets.
