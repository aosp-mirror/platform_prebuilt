<h4 class="subsection">5.1.3 Setting Catchpoints</h4>

<p><a name="index-catchpoints_002c-setting-242"></a><a name="index-exception-handlers-243"></a><a name="index-event-handling-244"></a>
You can use <dfn>catchpoints</dfn> to cause the debugger to stop for certain
kinds of program events, such as C<tt>++</tt> exceptions or the loading of a
shared library.  Use the <code>catch</code> command to set a catchpoint.

     
<a name="index-catch-245"></a>
<dl><dt><code>catch </code><var>event</var><dd>Stop when <var>event</var> occurs.  <var>event</var> can be any of the following:
          <dl>
<dt><code>throw</code><dd><a name="index-stop-on-C_0040t_007b_002b_002b_007d-exceptions-246"></a>The throwing of a C<tt>++</tt> exception.

          <br><dt><code>catch</code><dd>The catching of a C<tt>++</tt> exception.

          <br><dt><code>exception</code><dd><a name="index-Ada-exception-catching-247"></a><a name="index-catch-Ada-exceptions-248"></a>An Ada exception being raised.  If an exception name is specified
at the end of the command (eg <code>catch exception Program_Error</code>),
the debugger will stop only when this specific exception is raised. 
Otherwise, the debugger stops execution when any Ada exception is raised.

          <p>When inserting an exception catchpoint on a user-defined exception whose
name is identical to one of the exceptions defined by the language, the
fully qualified name must be used as the exception name.  Otherwise,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will assume that it should stop on the pre-defined exception
rather than the user-defined one.  For instance, assuming an exception
called <code>Constraint_Error</code> is defined in package <code>Pck</code>, then
the command to use to catch such exceptions is <kbd>catch exception
Pck.Constraint_Error</kbd>.

          <br><dt><code>exception unhandled</code><dd>An exception that was raised but is not handled by the program.

          <br><dt><code>assert</code><dd>A failed Ada assertion.

          <br><dt><code>exec</code><dd><a name="index-break-on-fork_002fexec-249"></a>A call to <code>exec</code>.  This is currently only available for HP-UX
and <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux.

          <br><dt><code>fork</code><dd>A call to <code>fork</code>.  This is currently only available for HP-UX
and <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux.

          <br><dt><code>vfork</code><dd>A call to <code>vfork</code>.  This is currently only available for HP-UX
and <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux.

          <br><dt><code>load</code><dt><code>load </code><var>libname</var><dd><a name="index-break-on-load_002funload-of-shared-library-250"></a>The dynamic loading of any shared library, or the loading of the library
<var>libname</var>.  This is currently only available for HP-UX.

          <br><dt><code>unload</code><dt><code>unload </code><var>libname</var><dd>The unloading of any dynamically loaded shared library, or the unloading
of the library <var>libname</var>.  This is currently only available for HP-UX. 
</dl>

     <br><dt><code>tcatch </code><var>event</var><dd>Set a catchpoint that is enabled only for one stop.  The catchpoint is
automatically deleted after the first time the event is caught.

   </dl>

   <p>Use the <code>info break</code> command to list the current catchpoints.

   <p>There are currently some limitations to C<tt>++</tt> exception handling
(<code>catch throw</code> and <code>catch catch</code>) in <span class="sc">gdb</span>:

     <ul>
<li>If you call a function interactively, <span class="sc">gdb</span> normally returns
control to you when the function has finished executing.  If the call
raises an exception, however, the call may bypass the mechanism that
returns control to you and cause your program either to abort or to
simply continue running until it hits a breakpoint, catches a signal
that <span class="sc">gdb</span> is listening for, or exits.  This is the case even if
you set a catchpoint for the exception; catchpoints on exceptions are
disabled within interactive calls.

     <li>You cannot raise an exception interactively.

     <li>You cannot install an exception handler interactively. 
</ul>

   <p><a name="index-raise-exceptions-251"></a>Sometimes <code>catch</code> is not the best way to debug exception handling:
if you need to know exactly where an exception is raised, it is better to
stop <em>before</em> the exception handler is called, since that way you
can see the stack before any unwinding takes place.  If you set a
breakpoint in an exception handler instead, it may not be easy to find
out where the exception was raised.

   <p>To stop just before an exception handler is called, you need some
knowledge of the implementation.  In the case of <span class="sc">gnu</span> C<tt>++</tt>, exceptions are
raised by calling a library function named <code>__raise_exception</code>
which has the following ANSI C interface:

<pre class="smallexample">         /* <var>addr</var> is where the exception identifier is stored.
            <var>id</var> is the exception identifier.  */
         void __raise_exception (void **addr, void *id);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">To make the debugger catch all exceptions before any stack
unwinding takes place, set a breakpoint on <code>__raise_exception</code>
(see <a href="Breakpoints.html#Breakpoints">Breakpoints; Watchpoints; and Exceptions</a>).

   <p>With a conditional breakpoint (see <a href="Conditions.html#Conditions">Break Conditions</a>)
that depends on the value of <var>id</var>, you can stop your program when
a specific exception is raised.  You can use multiple conditional
breakpoints to stop your program when any of a number of exceptions are
raised.
