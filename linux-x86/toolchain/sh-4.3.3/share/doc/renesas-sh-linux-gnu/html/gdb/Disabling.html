<h4 class="subsection">5.1.5 Disabling Breakpoints</h4>

<p><a name="index-enable_002fdisable-a-breakpoint-258"></a>Rather than deleting a breakpoint, watchpoint, or catchpoint, you might
prefer to <dfn>disable</dfn> it.  This makes the breakpoint inoperative as if
it had been deleted, but remembers the information on the breakpoint so
that you can <dfn>enable</dfn> it again later.

   <p>You disable and enable breakpoints, watchpoints, and catchpoints with
the <code>enable</code> and <code>disable</code> commands, optionally specifying one
or more breakpoint numbers as arguments.  Use <code>info break</code> or
<code>info watch</code> to print a list of breakpoints, watchpoints, and
catchpoints if you do not know which numbers to use.

   <p>Disabling and enabling a breakpoint that has multiple locations
affects all of its locations.

   <p>A breakpoint, watchpoint, or catchpoint can have any of four different
states of enablement:

     <ul>
<li>Enabled.  The breakpoint stops your program.  A breakpoint set
with the <code>break</code> command starts out in this state. 
<li>Disabled.  The breakpoint has no effect on your program. 
<li>Enabled once.  The breakpoint stops your program, but then becomes
disabled. 
<li>Enabled for deletion.  The breakpoint stops your program, but
immediately after it does so it is deleted permanently.  A breakpoint
set with the <code>tbreak</code> command starts out in this state. 
</ul>

   <p>You can use the following commands to enable or disable breakpoints,
watchpoints, and catchpoints:

     
<a name="index-disable-259"></a>
<a name="index-dis-_0040r_007b_0028_0040code_007bdisable_007d_0029_007d-260"></a>
<dl><dt><code>disable </code><span class="roman">[</span><code>breakpoints</code><span class="roman">]</span> <span class="roman">[</span><var>range</var><code>...</code><span class="roman">]</span><dd>Disable the specified breakpoints&mdash;or all breakpoints, if none are
listed.  A disabled breakpoint has no effect but is not forgotten.  All
options such as ignore-counts, conditions and commands are remembered in
case the breakpoint is enabled again later.  You may abbreviate
<code>disable</code> as <code>dis</code>.

     <p><a name="index-enable-261"></a><br><dt><code>enable </code><span class="roman">[</span><code>breakpoints</code><span class="roman">]</span> <span class="roman">[</span><var>range</var><code>...</code><span class="roman">]</span><dd>Enable the specified breakpoints (or all defined breakpoints).  They
become effective once again in stopping your program.

     <br><dt><code>enable </code><span class="roman">[</span><code>breakpoints</code><span class="roman">]</span><code> once </code><var>range</var><code>...</code><dd>Enable the specified breakpoints temporarily.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> disables any
of these breakpoints immediately after stopping your program.

     <br><dt><code>enable </code><span class="roman">[</span><code>breakpoints</code><span class="roman">]</span><code> delete </code><var>range</var><code>...</code><dd>Enable the specified breakpoints to work once, then die.  <span class="sc">gdb</span>
deletes any of these breakpoints as soon as your program stops there. 
Breakpoints set by the <code>tbreak</code> command start out in this state. 
</dl>

<!-- FIXME: I think the following ``Except for [...] @code{tbreak}'' is -->
<!-- confusing: tbreak is also initially enabled. -->
   <p>Except for a breakpoint set with <code>tbreak</code> (see <a href="Set-Breaks.html#Set-Breaks">Setting Breakpoints</a>), breakpoints that you set are initially enabled;
subsequently, they become disabled or enabled only when you use one of
the commands above.  (The command <code>until</code> can set and delete a
breakpoint of its own, but it does not change the state of your other
breakpoints; see <a href="Continuing-and-Stepping.html#Continuing-and-Stepping">Continuing and Stepping</a>.)
