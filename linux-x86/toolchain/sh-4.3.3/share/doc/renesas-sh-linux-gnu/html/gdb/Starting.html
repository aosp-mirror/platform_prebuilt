<dl><dt><code>run</code><dt><code>r</code><dd>Use the <code>run</code> command to start your program under <span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
You must first specify the program name (except on VxWorks) with an
argument to <span class="sc">gdb</span> (see <a href="Invocation.html#Invocation">Getting In and Out of <span class="sc">gdb</span></a>), or by using the <code>file</code> or <code>exec-file</code> command
(see <a href="Files.html#Files">Commands to Specify Files</a>).

   </dl>

   <p>If you are running your program in an execution environment that
supports processes, <code>run</code> creates an inferior process and makes
that process run your program.  In some environments without processes,
<code>run</code> jumps to the start of your program.  Other targets,
like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">remote</span></samp>&rsquo;, are always running.  If you get an error
message like this one:

<pre class="smallexample">     The "remote" target does not support "run".
     Try "help target" or "continue".
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">then use <code>continue</code> to run your program.  You may need <code>load</code>
first (see <a href="load.html#load">load</a>).

   <p>The execution of a program is affected by certain information it
receives from its superior.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> provides ways to specify this
information, which you must do <em>before</em> starting your program.  (You
can change it after starting your program, but such changes only affect
your program the next time you start it.)  This information may be
divided into four categories:

     <dl>
<dt>The <em>arguments.</em><dd>Specify the arguments to give your program as the arguments of the
<code>run</code> command.  If a shell is available on your target, the shell
is used to pass the arguments, so that you may use normal conventions
(such as wildcard expansion or variable substitution) in describing
the arguments. 
In Unix systems, you can control which shell is used with the
<code>SHELL</code> environment variable. 
See <a href="Arguments.html#Arguments">Your Program's Arguments</a>.

     <br><dt>The <em>environment.</em><dd>Your program normally inherits its environment from <span class="sc">gdb</span>, but you can
use the <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands <code>set environment</code> and <code>unset
environment</code> to change parts of the environment that affect
your program.  See <a href="Environment.html#Environment">Your Program's Environment</a>.

     <br><dt>The <em>working directory.</em><dd>Your program inherits its working directory from <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  You can set
the <span class="sc">gdb</span> working directory with the <code>cd</code> command in <span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
See <a href="Working-Directory.html#Working-Directory">Your Program's Working Directory</a>.

     <br><dt>The <em>standard input and output.</em><dd>Your program normally uses the same device for standard input and
standard output as <span class="sc">gdb</span> is using.  You can redirect input and output
in the <code>run</code> command line, or you can use the <code>tty</code> command to
set a different device for your program. 
See <a href="Input_002fOutput.html#Input_002fOutput">Your Program's Input and Output</a>.

     <p><a name="index-pipes-104"></a><em>Warning:</em> While input and output redirection work, you cannot use
pipes to pass the output of the program you are debugging to another
program; if you attempt this, <span class="sc">gdb</span> is likely to wind up debugging the
wrong program. 
</dl>

   <p>When you issue the <code>run</code> command, your program begins to execute
immediately.  See <a href="Stopping.html#Stopping">Stopping and Continuing</a>, for discussion
of how to arrange for your program to stop.  Once your program has
stopped, you may call functions in your program, using the <code>print</code>
or <code>call</code> commands.  See <a href="Data.html#Data">Examining Data</a>.

   <p>If the modification time of your symbol file has changed since the last
time <span class="sc">gdb</span> read its symbols, <span class="sc">gdb</span> discards its symbol
table, and reads it again.  When it does this, <span class="sc">gdb</span> tries to retain
your current breakpoints.

     
<a name="index-start-105"></a>
<dl><dt><code>start</code><dd><a name="index-run-to-main-procedure-106"></a>The name of the main procedure can vary from language to language. 
With C or C<tt>++</tt>, the main procedure name is always <code>main</code>, but
other languages such as Ada do not require a specific name for their
main procedure.  The debugger provides a convenient way to start the
execution of the program and to stop at the beginning of the main
procedure, depending on the language used.

     <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">start</span></samp>&rsquo; command does the equivalent of setting a temporary
breakpoint at the beginning of the main procedure and then invoking
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">run</span></samp>&rsquo; command.

     <p><a name="index-elaboration-phase-107"></a>Some programs contain an <dfn>elaboration</dfn> phase where some startup code is
executed before the main procedure is called.  This depends on the
languages used to write your program.  In C<tt>++</tt>, for instance,
constructors for static and global objects are executed before
<code>main</code> is called.  It is therefore possible that the debugger stops
before reaching the main procedure.  However, the temporary breakpoint
will remain to halt execution.

     <p>Specify the arguments to give to your program as arguments to the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">start</span></samp>&rsquo; command.  These arguments will be given verbatim to the
underlying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">run</span></samp>&rsquo; command.  Note that the same arguments will be
reused if no argument is provided during subsequent calls to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">start</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">run</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>It is sometimes necessary to debug the program during elaboration.  In
these cases, using the <code>start</code> command would stop the execution of
your program too late, as the program would have already completed the
elaboration phase.  Under these circumstances, insert breakpoints in your
elaboration code before running your program.

     <p><a name="index-set-exec_002dwrapper-108"></a><br><dt><code>set exec-wrapper </code><var>wrapper</var><dt><code>show exec-wrapper</code><dt><code>unset exec-wrapper</code><dd>When &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">exec-wrapper</span></samp>&rsquo; is set, the specified wrapper is used to
launch programs for debugging.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> starts your program
with a shell command of the form <kbd>exec </kbd><var>wrapper</var>
<var>program</var>.  Quoting is added to <var>program</var> and its
arguments, but not to <var>wrapper</var>, so you should add quotes if
appropriate for your shell.  The wrapper runs until it executes
your program, and then <span class="sc">gdb</span> takes control.

     <p>You can use any program that eventually calls <code>execve</code> with
its arguments as a wrapper.  Several standard Unix utilities do
this, e.g. <code>env</code> and <code>nohup</code>.  Any Unix shell script ending
with <code>exec "$@"</code> will also work.

     <p>For example, you can use <code>env</code> to pass an environment variable to
the debugged program, without setting the variable in your shell's
environment:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) set exec-wrapper env 'LD_PRELOAD=libtest.so'
          (gdb) run
</pre>
     <p>This command is available when debugging locally on most targets, excluding
<span class="sc">djgpp</span>, Cygwin, MS Windows, and QNX Neutrino.

     <p><a name="index-set-disable_002drandomization-109"></a><br><dt><code>set disable-randomization</code><dt><code>set disable-randomization on</code><dd>This option (enabled by default in <span class="sc">gdb</span>) will turn off the native
randomization of the virtual address space of the started program.  This option
is useful for multiple debugging sessions to make the execution better
reproducible and memory addresses reusable across debugging sessions.

     <p>This feature is implemented only on <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux.  You can get the same
behavior using

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) set exec-wrapper setarch `uname -m` -R
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>set disable-randomization off</code><dd>Leave the behavior of the started executable unchanged.  Some bugs rear their
ugly heads only when the program is loaded at certain addresses.  If your bug
disappears when you run the program under <span class="sc">gdb</span>, that might be because
<span class="sc">gdb</span> by default disables the address randomization on platforms, such
as <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux, which do that for stand-alone programs.  Use <kbd>set
disable-randomization off</kbd> to try to reproduce such elusive bugs.

     <p>The virtual address space randomization is implemented only on <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux. 
It protects the programs against some kinds of security attacks.  In these
cases the attacker needs to know the exact location of a concrete executable
code.  Randomizing its location makes it impossible to inject jumps misusing
a code at its expected addresses.

     <p>Prelinking shared libraries provides a startup performance advantage but it
makes addresses in these libraries predictable for privileged processes by
having just unprivileged access at the target system.  Reading the shared
library binary gives enough information for assembling the malicious code
misusing it.  Still even a prelinked shared library can get loaded at a new
random address just requiring the regular relocation process during the
startup.  Shared libraries not already prelinked are always loaded at
a randomly chosen address.

     <p>Position independent executables (PIE) contain position independent code
similar to the shared libraries and therefore such executables get loaded at
a randomly chosen address upon startup.  PIE executables always load even
already prelinked shared libraries at a random address.  You can build such
executable using <samp><span class="command">gcc -fPIE -pie</span></samp>.

     <p>Heap (malloc storage), stack and custom mmap areas are always placed randomly
(as long as the randomization is enabled).

     <br><dt><code>show disable-randomization</code><dd>Show the current setting of the explicit disable of the native randomization of
the virtual address space of the started program.
