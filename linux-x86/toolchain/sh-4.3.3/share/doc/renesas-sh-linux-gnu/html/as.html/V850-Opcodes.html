<p><a name="index-V850-opcodes-1858"></a><a name="index-opcodes-for-V850-1859"></a><code>as</code> implements all the standard V850 opcodes.

   <p><code>as</code> also implements the following pseudo ops:

     
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bhi0_007d-pseudo_002dop_002c-V850-1860"></a>
<dl><dt><code>hi0()</code><dd>Computes the higher 16 bits of the given expression and stores it into
the immediate operand field of the given instruction.  For example:

     <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mulhi hi0(here - there), r5, r6</span></samp>&rsquo;

     <p>computes the difference between the address of labels 'here' and
'there', takes the upper 16 bits of this difference, shifts it down 16
bits and then multiplies it by the lower 16 bits in register 5, putting
the result into register 6.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007blo_007d-pseudo_002dop_002c-V850-1861"></a><br><dt><code>lo()</code><dd>Computes the lower 16 bits of the given expression and stores it into
the immediate operand field of the given instruction.  For example:

     <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">addi lo(here - there), r5, r6</span></samp>&rsquo;

     <p>computes the difference between the address of labels 'here' and
'there', takes the lower 16 bits of this difference and adds it to
register 5, putting the result into register 6.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bhi_007d-pseudo_002dop_002c-V850-1862"></a><br><dt><code>hi()</code><dd>Computes the higher 16 bits of the given expression and then adds the
value of the most significant bit of the lower 16 bits of the expression
and stores the result into the immediate operand field of the given
instruction.  For example the following code can be used to compute the
address of the label 'here' and store it into register 6:

     <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">movhi hi(here), r0, r6</span></samp>&rsquo;
    &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">movea lo(here), r6, r6</span></samp>&rsquo;

     <p>The reason for this special behaviour is that movea performs a sign
extension on its immediate operand.  So for example if the address of
'here' was 0xFFFFFFFF then without the special behaviour of the hi()
pseudo-op the movhi instruction would put 0xFFFF0000 into r6, then the
movea instruction would takes its immediate operand, 0xFFFF, sign extend
it to 32 bits, 0xFFFFFFFF, and then add it into r6 giving 0xFFFEFFFF
which is wrong (the fifth nibble is E).  With the hi() pseudo op adding
in the top bit of the lo() pseudo op, the movhi instruction actually
stores 0 into r6 (0xFFFF + 1 = 0x0000), so that the movea instruction
stores 0xFFFFFFFF into r6 - the right value.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bhilo_007d-pseudo_002dop_002c-V850-1863"></a><br><dt><code>hilo()</code><dd>Computes the 32 bit value of the given expression and stores it into
the immediate operand field of the given instruction (which must be a
mov instruction).  For example:

     <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mov hilo(here), r6</span></samp>&rsquo;

     <p>computes the absolute address of label 'here' and puts the result into
register 6.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bsdaoff_007d-pseudo_002dop_002c-V850-1864"></a><br><dt><code>sdaoff()</code><dd>Computes the offset of the named variable from the start of the Small
Data Area (whoes address is held in register 4, the GP register) and
stores the result as a 16 bit signed value in the immediate operand
field of the given instruction.  For example:

     <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ld.w sdaoff(_a_variable)[gp],r6</span></samp>&rsquo;

     <p>loads the contents of the location pointed to by the label '_a_variable'
into register 6, provided that the label is located somewhere within +/-
32K of the address held in the GP register.  [Note the linker assumes
that the GP register contains a fixed address set to the address of the
label called '__gp'.  This can either be set up automatically by the
linker, or specifically set by using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--defsym __gp=&lt;value&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
command line option].

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007btdaoff_007d-pseudo_002dop_002c-V850-1865"></a><br><dt><code>tdaoff()</code><dd>Computes the offset of the named variable from the start of the Tiny
Data Area (whoes address is held in register 30, the EP register) and
stores the result as a 4,5, 7 or 8 bit unsigned value in the immediate
operand field of the given instruction.  For example:

     <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sld.w tdaoff(_a_variable)[ep],r6</span></samp>&rsquo;

     <p>loads the contents of the location pointed to by the label '_a_variable'
into register 6, provided that the label is located somewhere within +256
bytes of the address held in the EP register.  [Note the linker assumes
that the EP register contains a fixed address set to the address of the
label called '__ep'.  This can either be set up automatically by the
linker, or specifically set by using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--defsym __ep=&lt;value&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
command line option].

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bzdaoff_007d-pseudo_002dop_002c-V850-1866"></a><br><dt><code>zdaoff()</code><dd>Computes the offset of the named variable from address 0 and stores the
result as a 16 bit signed value in the immediate operand field of the
given instruction.  For example:

     <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">movea zdaoff(_a_variable),zero,r6</span></samp>&rsquo;

     <p>puts the address of the label '_a_variable' into register 6, assuming
that the label is somewhere within the first 32K of memory.  (Strictly
speaking it also possible to access the last 32K of memory as well, as
the offsets are signed).

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bctoff_007d-pseudo_002dop_002c-V850-1867"></a><br><dt><code>ctoff()</code><dd>Computes the offset of the named variable from the start of the Call
Table Area (whoes address is helg in system register 20, the CTBP
register) and stores the result a 6 or 16 bit unsigned value in the
immediate field of then given instruction or piece of data.  For
example:

     <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">callt ctoff(table_func1)</span></samp>&rsquo;

     <p>will put the call the function whoes address is held in the call table
at the location labeled 'table_func1'.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007blongcall_007d-pseudo_002dop_002c-V850-1868"></a><br><dt><code>.longcall name</code><dd>Indicates that the following sequence of instructions is a long call
to function <code>name</code>.  The linker will attempt to shorten this call
sequence if <code>name</code> is within a 22bit offset of the call.  Only
valid if the <code>-mrelax</code> command line switch has been enabled.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007blongjump_007d-pseudo_002dop_002c-V850-1869"></a><br><dt><code>.longjump name</code><dd>Indicates that the following sequence of instructions is a long jump
to label <code>name</code>.  The linker will attempt to shorten this code
sequence if <code>name</code> is within a 22bit offset of the jump.  Only
valid if the <code>-mrelax</code> command line switch has been enabled.
