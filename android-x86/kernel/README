The file 'kernel' gets copied to the generic_x86 image. Replace it with
the kernel from which you wish to boot. The same kernel is used for the
installer_dvi image as well as for the boot kernel.

The file 'kernel_config_VirtualBox' is a .config file for the Android
2.6.32 kernel tree that can boot and run fairly well using VirtualBox.
